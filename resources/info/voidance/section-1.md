# Voidance and Devoidance

In this world, some enemies can make you weak, this happens at the beginning of the fight, before the attacks are handled.

Regular critters won&#39;t void you much, although harder creatures in the list can (10-15%) While Celestials can void you starting at 50%.

## What does it mean to be voided?

- Your affixes won&#39;t fire.
- Your stats won&#39;t include any modifications (raw stats)
- Your artifacts will not fire
- Your health will be much lower (raw DUR lower)

> Character Devouring Light and Darkness will fire before the enemies. If the enemy is devoided or voided or has their stats reduced,
> that will affect the enemy the entire battle, as it would you.

## How do I prevent this?

By completing a small quest chain that involves Gold Dust and the starter item you can purchase, for Gold Dust from The Soldier (all these items, listed below, can be bought on the surface.

- Creepy Baby Doll – Buy from soldier for 25k Gold Dust
    - Makes your affixes irresistible. You can still be voided though, thus even with this item it won&#39;t help much against being voided
- Shadow Plane Grimoire – Buy from the Wondering Merchant (Requires Creepy Baby Doll and 30,000 Gold Dust)
    - Your affixes are still irresistible, but now you have a 50% to void the enemy and a 15% to devoid them
- Eye of the Beholder – Buy from the Wondering Merchant (Requires Shadow Plane Grimore and 50k Gold Dust)
    - Your affixes are still irresistible, but now you have a 75% to void the enemy and a 50% chance to devoid them
- Dead Kings Crown – Buy from the Wondering Merchant (Requires Eye of the Beholder and 75k Gold dust)
    - Your affixes are still irresistible, but now you have a 100% chance to void your enemy and 85% chance to devoid them.

Void and devoid are known as: Devouring Light and Devouring Darkness.

No enemy, at the time of this writing, will devoid you.

## What happens if I devoid an enemy?

If you have a Devouring Darkness chance (If you have Shadow Plane Grimoire at the least) you have a chance to STOP an enemy from voiding you. Should this fire successfully, you then have a chance (with the same quest item) to void the enemy:

- Their affixes will not fire.
- Their artifacts will not fire.

If you do not manage to void them you will still attempt to void the enemy.

The enemy cannot then re-void you on their turn, no matter how many rounds a fight lasts, the enemy, nor you, can re-void or re-devoid. It&#39;s a once per battle situation.

The only way, at this time, that you can get Devouring Darkness or Devouring Light is through the quest item upgrade chain. **There are no affixes to handle this.**
