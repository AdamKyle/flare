# Planes Of Tlessa
------------------

<em>Welcome traveler! I am glad you could stop by. Sit for a moment, I have something I want to

Maybe you want to adventure deep into the dungeons and fight off fearsome monsters, train up the battle skills and loot all the items!

Or perhaps you want to settle a kingdom or two, or three or all of them!

You have come to the right place my friend; you have come to The Planes of Tlessa!</em>

## Biggest Selling Points!

-	**No real-world money can be used to buy any item or advancement**. You want it? You earn it!
-	**Not completely idle based**. There are some idle mechanics, such as [Adventuring](/information/adventure) and [Kingdoms](/information/kingdoms), however if you are looking to set it and forget it, that’s not Tlessa!
-	**No Energy Systems!** Instead we use what are called: [Time gates](/information/time-gates). These can range from 10 seconds to a few minutes! The goal is for you to stay engaged!
-	**Simple and easy interface**. The goal of Tlessa is to be easy to understand. Everything is laid out for you in a way where you know instinctively what a button does, or an action does.
-	**Real time chat and offline progression are a thing!** Want to chat with your friends? You can in real time including private messaging them! (see [rules](/information/rules)). Have to log out, but you are in the middle of an adventure? Don’t worry we got you, go about your day, you’ll get an email when it’s completed, assuming you have those settings turned on.
-	**Completely open source!** Found a bug, want a feature? Make a pull request! See the [source here](https://github.com/AdamKyle/flare)

These are some of the biggest selling points of the game. I wanted to create a game that was something I would play. **Every day, all day**. 

With that said, some players might be put off by the “not everyone is limited” by some kind of energy system allowing players to essentially play all day, every day. This can mean that someone who has more time than you, can get ahead of you. 

That doesn't mean you are less than. There is no end game. You make of it what you want. If you want to rule the markets, you will craft items, enchant them and sell them.

If you want to rule the land, you’ll settle kingdoms and take your opponents kingdoms. There is no faction system here, no clans. It’s every man, woman and child (you must be 18+ to play Tlessa, due to the nature of chat) for themselves. (Read more about [kingdoms]()).

If you want to just find the longest running adventure and run that over and over again for the loot to sell on the market, then go ahead.

There is something for everyone, it just depends on what you want to do. Run the markets? Own all the kingdoms? Go on every adventure? You can do it all.

## Why?

It's simple really. I wanted to make a game that I wanted to play with inspiration from games I have played. Thats really the main purpose. I am a software developer by trade, it's what I do all day, every day. So why not use my down time to create something. 

I was really inspired by a game called [Race War Kingdoms](https://www.racewarkingdoms.com/) as well as a few other games. I wanted to keep things simple, clean and easy to use. But I wanted to expand on some systems and make them easier and more enjoyable to use.

## Emails

## A Word On Sessions

When your session times out, that is - you have been gone for 15 minutes or longer, your screen may look frozen, timer's might have stopped, adventures might have completed but
show no notices. Your session has timed out, and you can fix this by refreshing.

I also kill your session when you close the browser or tab.

## FAQ

<div class="mb-3">

- **Where are the cash shops or currency shops to buy items or gold**: As stated through out this information section, there is no way your money will get you any where in game because there is no cash shop or way for you to spend real world money.

- **How do you make money, are there adds?**: There are no adds, I make no money off this game what so ever. It is completely open source. In order to pay for server costs, I have a job and a credit card.

- **How do I get rid of [time gates](/information/time-gates)**: You don't. This is how we slow you down a bit and stop you from overwhelming the server. 

- **What Browsers are supported?**: Anything other than any version of Internet Explorer. This game will never support Internet Explorer, but we do support Edge. (Javascript is a must)

- **Are their Clans? Factions or Guilds?**: No. Its every player for them selves.

- **PVP?**: Coming in a later update.

- **Player to Player Trading?**: No, there is however a [market board](/information/market-board).

## Regarding how updates work.

This game follows a semver system for it's versioning system. For those that do not know what semver is, it basically means the following:

example: a.b.c

- **a** is major releases, this corresponds to expansions that bring major new features, changes and re-balancing. The idea is to have these happen every year or so. With no commitment on when they will be released.
- **b** is for minor features and changes including re-balancing. These might include minor enhancements, quality of life, slight changes, flushing out of existing features without too much change or adding small new features. The goal is release these, once every 6 months or so (with no commitment on when).
- **c** is for patches. These include game breaking fixes, small patches to fix known issues, small ui fixes and re-balancing. These happen ASAP (with in two days) for game breaking bugs and with in a week for other issues.

Because I am a software developer by day (it's what pays for the server costs) I cannot commit to timelines, unless something is seriously broken and not working.

When doing major releases, these are considered to be "expansions". That come with at least one new plane of existence and lots of new features.

### Rollouts of new features, bugs and changes

Rollout are done in a way to be zero downtime. However, with that said - all rollouts will happen after 10pm America/Edmonton time. You can read the release notes [here](/releases) for all releases.

There is an exception to the release notes:

- If the release notes make mention of new items, planes of existence, monsters, locations, adventures, enchantments, skills or changes to existing items or previously mentioned, these will be done after the rollout. The game has an Admin section that I, The Creator, have access too.
I, The Creator, will send a global message to chat informing all players to refresh their pages for the changes to take effect, in regard to new items and changes.

## Regarding Bugs

If you find a bug in game - especially one that is exploitable, and you fail to report the bug you can have your account banned for ever. [See Rules](/information/rules).

You can report bugs by going to [github](https://github.com/AdamKyle/flare/issues) and filing a new issue. There are three templates to choose from: 

- **Bug Report**: For bugs in game.
- **New Feature Request**: For requesting new features
- **Security Concern**: Accessing areas you can't such as other players content or admin related content.

Since not every one has github you can use the [discord](https://discord.gg/FHYVdcE3Pf) chat to report bugs in the bugs section or request new features in the suggestions section.
