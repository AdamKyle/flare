# NPC’s

Npc’s in Planes of Tlessa are entities that you can interact with via chat only. 
Some NPC’s will require you to be at their location, while others don’t care where you are. If an NPC requires you to be at 
their location, and you message them when you are not, you will see:

In chat.

To interact with an NPC you can type: `/m NPCName: Command` This is done the same way as private messaging another player in game.

There are three types of NPC’s in Tlessa: Kingdom Owner, Quest Giver and Conjurer.

## Kingdom Owner NPC

This npc is responsible for taking kingdoms from players who have not walked their kingdoms in at least 5 days.

They will hold the kingdom and allow other players to attack or take the kingdom via a command.

Should a character delete their account, all their kingdoms are handed to the NPC who holds the kingdoms.

If no one takes these kingdoms with in five days of the NPC being given or taking the kingdom, the kingdom will crumble into ruins, freeing up
the space for another player, maybe a new player, to settle a new kingdom.

## Quest NPC

These NPC’s can take items, gold, gold dust and shards from you in exchange for rewards. 
For example there is currently a quest to unlock alchemy in which one has to defeat a Celestial Entity to get a quest item to drop.

Upon obtaining the quest item the player would then message the NPC to exchange the quest item.

Quest NPC’s usually require you to be at their location to make the exchange. 
Upon doing so, you'll get a global message in chat along with server messages for the reward:

## Conjurer NPC

These NPC’s usually require you to be at their location in order to conjure. Much like a Quest NPC.

Upon messaging a Conjurer NPC, a new panel will open:

From here you can select the celestial the type of conjuration. You can read more about celestial entities here.

Upon selecting one and conjuring (lets do private)

[Private conjure]

You will see a global message, and you will be given the coordinates.

You can also choose to conjure publicly, in which case every one will get a global message:

[PUBLIC conjure]
