# NPC's

Tless comes with NPC characters that you interact with via chat. To do this you would type, into the chat box:

    /m NPCName: Command

This will show messages to you based on what you are attempting to do. To conjure [Celestials](/information/celestials),
[Taking Kingdoms](/information/npc-kingdoms) or to complete [quests](/information/quests).

As you might have noticed there is a verity that you can do. Below is a list of NPC's along with their accepted commands.

These commands must be typed exactly, or they won't work.

Some NPC's, as you can see below, require you to be at their exact location. You can always mesage a NPc their command to see where they are
as they will tell you their location and what plane they are on.

Some NPC's can be on Water or (with Dungeons plane) Death Water, so make sure you have the appropriate quest item to access the NPC.

Finally, NPC's with multiple quests or "Quest Chains", will require you to speak to the NPC multiple times to complete each quest.
