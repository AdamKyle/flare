# Tips for New Players

The first tip I can give you is to **Take your time**. You are not going to get anywhere fast in this game. It takes time, dedication and 
commitment. With that, lets get into some basic tips:

## Early Game is going to be slow

Early game will be a bit difficult, not impossible, just a bit harder. You are basically naked wondering around trying to kill things. Later on, below, I have a small 
leveling tip for you. 

As you progress and are able to buy or make better equipment, the game get easier to progress through. Take your time and focus on what you can kill to start.

## Learn your class

The [races and classes](/information/races-and-classes) documentation goes over all the races and classes. Each class has its own tips
and tricks for optimizing your class.

## Gear for your class

Armour is the only gear that will increase all of your stats, while shields will increase dur, weapons increase str and dex and bows dex and agility. Finally,
spells will increase int/focus or chr/focus.

There are a variety of [enchantments](/information/enchanting) for you to apply to weapons and armour. You should take a moment to learn how [combat](/information/combat)
works in game and then choose enchantments based on your preferred attack style.

## Set goals for your self

The early game is going to be hard, you might only be able to kill one or two creatures. Your first goal should be getting enough gold
to outfit your self with some decent gear from the shop.

To do this, start by using the 250 gold you have to equip some slightly better equipment. Then work your way down the list, you probably won't get further than
Goblin. That's ok - make sure you can kill it in one or two shots. Next head over to Smugglers Port a [Location](/information/locations) and do the [adventure](/information/adventure) Smugglers Port.

You should get some items from doing the adventure, compare them against what you have and make adjustments.

Now that you have some gold and some experience, time to think about what you want to do.

Try to set realistic goals. There is a lot to do in Tessa, and it will take you some time to get up there to do a lot of it.

For example if you would like to get more experience and drops you should work your way down to Dungeons [plane](/information/planes) through doing a series
of [Quests](/information/quests) and killing some harder creatures to get the drops to complete the appropriate quests.

## Do not try and max your skills before you are max level.

There are two max levels in this game. One is 1000, and the other is (at the time of this writing) 3500 which increases 100 levels per month.

To get the second level cap you have to Kill a Satanic Cult Leader to get a Leather Sash. You then need Labyrinth Access to trade it to the Labyrinth Weaver
and he will give you a new sash that lets you continue leveling. Without you are limited to level 1000 and limited in power.

The idea is to focus on your leveling and maybe one other skill depending on your class (Accuracy or Casting Accuracy) while you level to max level. Along the way you
might want to craft your own gear if you have the funds.

Doing this will raise your crafting levels and as you enchant the items and later disenchant them, your gold dust which is used to purchase some quest items.

## One step at a time

The whole point of this tip section is to tell you to not get flustered. Maybe you only do a level or two a day, or a few adventures a week or manage your kingdoms every other day.

It's all a slow steady grind to the top. What's at the top? Harder creatures and [Celestials](/information/celestials).

Kingdoms also come in handy the higher the level you are, specifically for crafting high-end items that cannot be purchased from the shop and access to high-end damage dealing end game enchantments
