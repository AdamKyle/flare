## Tips for new players

> *Ahem!*

> 
> *And there never will be!*

I could list out things you should focus on, things you should and should not do. That's fun and all, but instead let me
walk you through the couple of hours of the game for you. I'll provide screenshots so you can follow along.

Tlessa has a lot of systems and sub systems and ways of managing your character, from skills, enchantments, alchemical items, 
special items found at special locations, quest items and so on. Looking at the game, one might think Tlessa is a mess of systems, but they are all interconnected
together and play off each other such that they all come together in the end to give you a sense of accomplishment and feel like, after a long road, that you 
"did this". you, the player invested time and energy and created a god killing character who rules the lands. The best part is, you didn't have to spend any money to do it.

What I pick for race and class will be different from you. But that's ok. 
You can still follow along and adjust accordingly for your own class.

First, let's check our [race and class](/information/races-and-classes) and pick one we want to play as. You can't change this, 
but you can delete your account and create a new one, should you want something else.

Got a race and class picked out? Great, so now that you have registered, you will be greeted wth this:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/game-section.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/game-section.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

*This is ... Intense.* Don't worry, I am about to make it slightly worse. Do me a favour and right click, open in a new tab the 
character sheet from the menu:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/character-sheet-menu.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/character-sheet-menu.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

*Oh christ! that got even more terrifying*. Relax. Don't try and digest it all, we don't care about the info on the character sheet section yet.

It is more beneficial to play with these two tabs open, this way you can refresh the character sheet and not loose focus of chat. Where's chat?
In the first image it's the black box at the bottom. That's where things like server messages (that only you can see), other player messages, global messages, admin messages
and npc messages will appear. It's imperative you pay attention to the information in the chat section. Drops, new levels, gold rushes, quest messages, celestial spawn messages - so much happens in chat.

So what now? Head back to the game tab, and first select Sewer Rat from the dropdown list in the Action Section, like so:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/first-battle.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/first-battle.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You should see what I see, now hover over those attack buttons you see. You can read the [combat docs](/information/combat) for further info, but based on your class you should use the correct
attack type or experiment with different attack types. For example, Casters - such as Heretics, want to use Cast attack (second button from the left), Prophets might one of the Attack and Cast or Cast and Attack buttons
while Fights and other classes might just use Attack. Again feel free to experiment.

There is also a [setting](/information/settings) that you can turn on, once you are more comfortable to disable the popovers for the attack buttons.

**But for now** Just click attack. Just do it. Don't ask questions, click the red button child! click it!!!!

Great:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/first-attack.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/first-attack.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You may see death. You may have died. You may see this, you may have killed it after a couple attacks. You may see nothing because you never did I told you and clicked the button!

Either way this is no good, and we need better gear. Right now, it doesn't matter what your class is, you have 1000 Gold. You can see this in the top section of the game window
where it states your name, class and gold.

So lets go shopping. Let's open the shop window - which will open in a new tab, here's where to find in the menu:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/shopping.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/shopping.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Fantastic. 

So now, you will buy:

- Warriors Battle Axe (Weapon)
- Goblin Flesh Shield (Shield)
- Dark Fairy Leaf Plate (Body)

To do this, from the shop window:

- Click the blue dropdown button called: Type
- Select the appropriate type
- (or) Search the list for the item based on name
- Click Compare
- Click Buy and Replace

Do this for each item, you should have 100 gold left. Go back to the game tab (you can close the shop tab). If you were blocked, missed or were killed
by the sewer rat, try again - now it should die! Killed it? Amazing! We are gods!

*Wait! What about my class, I am ....* No one cares child! Right now you are useless to the gods! Your gear, as you will see when you go to equip it from buying it,
will increase stats on your character.

On your character sheet is a section:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/to-hit-info.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/to-hit-info.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see the **Stat to focus on for max damage** and the **To focus on for Hit%** these stats and skill may be different for your class,
however later, we will learn about [enchantments](/information/enchanting) and [random enchants (uniques)](/information/random-enchants) that turn your items green!

These can further raise the states, even specialize in specific stats, skills, damage types and so on. Later when you are not weak and pathetic and
can hold your own, you can invest in these items. We will even do some later on! How fun!

Come now child, back to the task at hand ...

You still have that character sheet open in one of those tabs right? If so, close any tab other than Game tab and the character sheet. Great!

Now, on the character sheet at the very top, look for a tab called [Factions](/information/factions). Click it.

You should see a table of map names, and factions. We're going to do the first one together, Surface. When we are done you will be the Mercenary of Surface
and have a very powerful unique item, that will grow with you as you level. But more on that later.

To get started, which we already sort of have, we just have to kill anything. So yes we could kill sewer rats, so - actually do that - go kill on the game tab and come back here.

....

Ya you only got one point, you have to do that till you reach 500. That's boring! So what I want you to do, to get the most out of this process is to go to the game tab, 
click the monster list and select the next one, Goblin. Can you kill it in one hit? yes? Keep going, next monster - stop when you can't kill it in one hit, or die.

Now go back to the one you could kill in one hit and remember it's name.

Click Attack Automation:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/attack-automation.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/attack-automation.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

This looks daunting, but I promise, it's easy. First select your monster that you could kill in one hit from the list and the Attack attack type, like so:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/selected-monster-automation.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/selected-monster-automation.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Your monster may differ. That's ok. Next head over to advanced to fill out some questions, like I have:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/advanced-attack-automation.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/advanced-attack-automation.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Let's go over this:

We are saying, for one hour we want to attack this creature, the one we selected, over and over again [automatically](/information/automation).

While we do so, we want to sacrifice 10% of the xp we would gain, to train the skill (in my case accuracy, one second) we have selected.

I want you, the player, to think for second what skill you would need to train - I'll give a hint, non casters should focus on Accuracy, While Casters should focus on Casting Accuracy. Except Prophets.

Prophets are mostly healing based class, who would benefit from going the Attack and Cast or Cast and Attack route. So for them, I would suggest 
you train Accuracy. This way you can buy a healing spell, equip it and use either Cast and Attack or Attack and cast and heal your self as you attack.

Healing spells can never miss and healing spells have a chance to resurrect you and heal you again! Prophets can attack with Damage spells but
are weaker than Heretics as they don't get an Intelligence boost. Damage spells also increase the Intelligence and Focus of a Heretic, while Healing spells
will increase your Charisma (chr) ad Focus.

Don't focus on the other [skills](/information/skill-information) right now, we shall detail some of those a bit later

> ### ATTN!!
> 
> If you picked casting accuracy, once this hour of auto battle is up, you should be able to select cast as your preferred attack
> style - assuming you have a damage spell equipped, which you can get from the shop. This really only applies to Heretics.

The reason we are doing this is because of that factions tab. To get the 500 kills we need an automatic way to farm the kills. There is no downside to doing this, there is but
one rule: **YOU MUST STAY LOGGED IN**. Put the game into another tab or browser, I don't care. But if your session dies or you log out - your attack automation will stop.

Also, if you choose the 8-hour session, (we only need the one hour for this walk through) and manage to do all 8 hours without you dying, the session being killed - you will be locked
out of auto battle for the rest of the day.

However, if you do an hour here, 6 hours a couple of hours later and 2 hours 5 minutes after that - it won't count. It has to be 8 solid uninterrupted hours.

You can be "inactive", that is doing nothing, in game for 90 minutes before your session dies. The other reason I had you open the character screen was so that if you are
using automation heavily, you can just refresh that screen - as mentioned before.

Now that we have this automation set up. Click begin:

> ## ATTN!
> 
> Ahem! I forgot something, if you wanted to, you could have the automation move down the list. Because you are new and squishy, I would set the 
> movement at every 20 levels, this way we will move down the list every 20 character levels.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/automation-began.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/automation-began.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Enjoy my friend. Sit back, go get a coffee, relax. Don't close the tab, don't log out, just enjoy the fruits of your labour. Your character sheet will update in  real time.

Come back in  an hour. We will begin phase two!

You may not have gotten all the points needed for the Surface faction, on the faction tab of the character sheet, so - I would like you to head to the shop
now and purchase some better gear. If you are a caster, focus on Damage spells for intelligence and focus (for Heretics) and healing spells for 
Prophets and Rangers.

If you are a Ranger, go buy a bow and equip it. Bows will increase your Agility and Dexterity. Bows are also used for your class skill to have a chance
to fire your bow off an additional 3x without missing or being blocked.

Yes, all classes have a special attack like this:

- Fighters: Double Attack (Attack again!)
- Rangers: Triple Attack (Notch and release three arrows in the enemies' direction)
- Prophets: Double Heal (Heal again)
- Heretics: Double Cast (Cast again)
- Thieves: Shadow Dance - Dance through the shadows and auto hit.

These all come from the [classes](/information/races-and-classes) class skill which you can read more about by selecting your class from the table on that help page.

You can raise the class bonus of these skills, which is a base 5%, meaning you have 5% chance to fire off your special attack, via special enchantments.

These will fire automatically during battle, all of them have special requirements before they will apply their effect or be usable. For example: Rangers, to get their triple attack must 
have a bow equipped. For Thieves, you must duel wield and so on.

Vampire is the only class who does not have a requirement for their special attack to land. They can equip anything.

Now before you continue with automation, look at your accuracy skill on the character sheet, it might be level 20, 30, 40 or even higher.

Let's switch that your class skill - which is documented on the [classes](/information/races-and-clases) page. Just click on the class that is yours, and it will tell you
the class skill.

Once you spent some of that hard-earned gold, repeat the auto battle, by just licking Begin, again. We will do this until you reach: Mercenary of Surface.

What about all your items you have accumulated from your auto battle? You can, before beginning the next one, go through them and investigate if any are good enough
for you at your level, but based on the gold you might have gotten, the "starter drops" may just be useless trash to you now. If you would like, you could
[disenchant](/information/disenchanting) them all, which will raise the skill - making it easier to disenchant over time.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> Caution when just auto disenchanting what drops. Just because the gear might be weaker, the enchantment might be good for you, especially since we haven't
> enchanted or crafted anything yet. So look at the stats on the affixes and see if they raise anything useful on your class.
> 
> For example, Vampires want anything with life steal on it. These can stack for you to a maximum of 99%. That means you steal 99% of the enemies' health.
> These are not "kill enchantments" but that's ok, your attack alone will kill the enemy.
> 
> *Kill enchantments for vampires, are those that both steal life AND do damage, regardless of if the damage is stackable or not.*

As you disenchant more items, you will level the disenchanting skill which makes it easier to disenchant items over time as well as level the enchanting skill
which will also make it easier to enchant items.

You also see the enchanted drops on the market, but you would have to be at a port [location](/information/location) to access the market. You can travel to the closest one
to you at 160/80 - Smugglers Port. Port locations are blue ship icons on the map, while pinkish arches are locations of interest that can have adventures or be [special locations](/information/special-locations).

Locations with [adventures](/information/adventure) let you set your character into "auto attack mode" and fight multiple monsters per level, getting loot, experience, skill experience ad gold.

Locations that are special, will contain monsters that are the same you fight in the dropdown list but are much harder. These places can drop special 
items called Gems (more on that later) and any item (of any value) with any enchantment from any enemy 10 levels or higher than you.

There is a special location for each [plane](/information/planes). Shadow Plane is the only plane that has the same drops as Special locations and stronger monsters.

Shadow plane will not drop gems, but it's special location will. For now lets focus on what we were doing, getting a faction title!

Once you have decided what to do with your gear, lets go back to auto battling, you may be able to fight harder critters, so do the list trick again, pick up from where you last left off
and continue down the monster list - remember, you want to one shot kill the enemy. Once you have it, continue auto battling with that new monster selected.

## Got the Faction title now? Excellent!

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/tips/images/unique-enchantment.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/tips/images/unique-enchantment.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

*Your item will differ from mine, maybe not in enchantment or item, but the stats on the enchantment will differ* 

Let's talk about this unique item, an item you are holding could be worth trillions of gold. Tlessa has two types of enchantments. Ones you have been seeing drop on random 
items, up to a specific price range which are all craftable and then these: uniques.

You can find this item in your character sheet, in the inventory section (it will be green). Your character sheet is live and will update in real time, no need to ever refresh unless
it is to keep your session alive, with that said, if you ever refresh the game tab, refresh the character sheet to keep them in sync.

What you are holding, NO ONE ELSE HAS. Or if they do, It's extremely rare. No I did not just hand you a way to be god, you have to earn that. Through leveling.

See all gear raises your stats, [enchantments](/information/enchanting) and [random enchantments](/information/random-enchants) (Affixes) also raise the stats on top of the gear on top of each other.

If 1 piece of gear adds 10% to your strength, and it has two enchants that adds 40% each, that's not a combined 90%, That's your strength + 10%, then that value + 40% then that, plus another 40%.

All enchants and gear stack on top each other. Specific aspects of the enchantment may not stack or may, but only for specific classes, like how vampires life stealing 
will stack to a maximum of 99% but other classes, we take the best life stealing of all their affixes.

But all this stacking means nothing, if your core stats are really low. So this unique, could be 115% on everything and be super awesome, and it is, don't get me wrong, equip it and watch you become a 
mini god. But there is more, you have to continue to level, the higher the level the more damage the item (or in this case the enchantment) can do.

Take a moment and read through [enchanting](/information/enchanting) as it lists all the various types of enchantments you can craft in game. These enchantments, the green uniqueue ones,
will not show up in any of those lists because you cannot craft these. You get them from Faction Farming and the [Queen of Hearts](/information/npcs) in Hell.

Save these green items, because there is a [NPC](/information/npcs) that can re-roll them, even transfer them to other items for a price.

These items are late game and from faction farming you can get 25 of them. when you get to late game, you will be rewarded with the opportunity to push
your character even further by being able to re-roll aspects of these enchants and transfer them to, essentially, god tier items that you can craft and then upgrade. 

You can push your stats well into the trillions, becoming unstoppable.

All of this will take time though.

At that point you unlock so much more of the game. But one small step at a time. Equip your mini god item. To keep things safe, such as these uniques, check out the section on
[sets](/information/equipment-sets). These will be valuable to you.

## Auto Battling and Crafting

Now it's time, with our little green unique, to go and continue the progress towards level cap. There are [Quests](/information/quests) that you can do. I would search through
the [planes](/information/planes) as they have all the locations and npc's that offer quests which as simple as speaking to them with the currency or item or both.

While you auto battle, you can also craft - which will let you train a new type of skill: [crafting](/information/crafting). You can craft all the items you 
see in the shop and even ones you do not - known as craft only items. Once you reach the crating cap, can you can then upgrade the top end gear
for even better gear - much later in the game.

this gear will be useless without [enchantments](/information/enchantments) and there are a lot to pick from.

Here's your next task child:

I want you to aim for killing a Labyrinth Fiend on the surface. You may need to train looting while auto battling or manually battling. 

If you are able to kill such a creature, eventually a Labyrinth Key will drop allowing you to use the [traverse](/information/traverse) command (under the map) 
to travel to the Labyrinth plane to take on harder creatures, get more drops and experience.

Each plane, off the Surface plane, will offer some kind of bonus, be it XP, Skill XP or Drop Rates.

You will farm more Faction points and gain more items. From here continue to upgrade your gear in between sessions.

Next while auto battling craft 75 items, what ever you want. Just craft 75. If you unlock more items, try moving down the list. Maybe you want to craft your self some gear.

Once you have the 75 items crafted, select the enchanting under the additional action dropdown, where crafting was. Pick some enchants, or use the aforementioned links to 
pick level appropriate enchantments and start enchanting till all 75 items are done. If there are any good items in there that you want to use, equip them and 
discard the rest by either stopping auto battle and selling them, on the market or by disenchanting for [gold dust](/information/currencies) which is vital in some quests.

The Shop won't take your enchanted gear and there is no player to player trade, your only option is to disenchant what you created, or sell them on the market board in hopes
someone buys them, thus you can start making some coin.

## You won't get far ...

So you might be enjoying the auto battling and buying shop gear and look, ooo shiny green items are falling from the sky. But without the right enchantments for your class,
for example - Life stealing for vampires with a damage relic - or intelligence based enchantments for Heretics. There is a whole world of customization for your character,
from passive skills that effect and unlock things such as passive buffs, blueprints for new buildings and so on, for your kingdoms.

Your character, as they grow, will only get as powerful as the amount of time you are willing to invest. Sure you can kill a Satanic Cult Leader, but are you utilizing the power
of your character? Can they kill the same critter in a [special location]()? Are you getting every last bit of power out of your character?

If you are a heretic, are you casting as opposed to attacking?

You will also need to craft/enchant while fighting to raise your crafting and enchanting levels. While yes Disenchanting will raise the enchanting level, you only get 50%
of the xp you would get for enchanting applied when disenchanting.

Again, yes you can buy the shop gear - maybe throw in some shiny green uniques, but without gearing properly towards your class, you won't be utilizing it's full potential
to be able to do the mass amounts of damage required for special locations, Shadow Plane or even Hell (mid to end game locations).

For example a Level 234 Fighter, decked out in enchanted gear (that they made or bought) will be stronger than a character in nothing but shop gear and a couple
of the faction uniques at the same level/class.

## The end of the walk through ...

Phew child! We made it!

We haven't even scratched the surface! We haven't talked about [Kingdoms](/information/kingdoms) or even [Alchemy](/information/alchemy) a skill locked behind a quest!

We haven't even touched [Passive skills](/information/passive-skills) or half the other information. But alas this is where I leave you to explore on your own.

There is a ton of infromation here in the help docs to answer questions, and should you have more - come to [discord](https://discord.gg/hcwdqJUerh) where I shall answer them all!
