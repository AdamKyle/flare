## Attacking Kingdoms with Items

There is another way, which requires the use of Alchemy, a locked skill in which you need to complete a quest 
to unlock and be able to start leveling.

Once you have unlocked the skill and have the required currencies: Shards and Gold Dust, you can create usable items.

One of those items, is a weapon that you can use on kingdoms ro reduce them to rubble. However, even if you drop everything
to zero, you will need to still send in a settler.

## How to use these items.

You might notice, in your inventory, under usable items a "damages kingdom" item, assuming you crafted one. These items cannot be used
from the inventory - instead they are used when you attack an enemy kingdom:

You will see an extra first step, before selecting your kingdoms in which to attack from. This allows you to select as many items
as you wish to drop on that one kingdom.

> ### ATTN!

> At this time, kingdoms damaging items do not spill out into other surrounding kingdoms.

Once you selected the items, you can click "use" to use the items.

A global message will go out indicating that you used items on a kingdom. 

The defending character will get an attack log:

If the defending character has the appropriate setting enabled they will get an email alert.

You can then go and select the kingdoms and units to send to attack the kingdom.
