# Character Stats

-----------------

As we talked about in [Races and Classes](/information/races-and-classes), the race you select and the class you select give bonus points towards your stats. Your class also determines your base attack stat. 

For optimal game play, it’s suggested that you equip gear that helps boost your primary damage stat as well as your dexterity (more on that later).

However, as stated before, you should never feel pigeonholed into one specific class or race because “it’s most optimal.” Experiment.

    </a>

In the above image you can see, in the inventory section, a **Stat to focus on for max damage**. This is your classes core stat.

The core stats of a character are:

-	Strength (str)
-	Durability (dur)
-	Dexterity (dex)
-	Intelligence (int)
-	Charisma (chr)

Each class corresponds to one of these stats for their base damage stat.

## Dexterity, AC and Your Skills

When it comes to being able to attack, that is actually hit your enemy, you’ll need to raise your dexterity. This is to counter their AC and their Dodge. Your accuracy plays a role in attempting to land an attack on the enemy. You can compensate for lack of accuracy levels, by equipping gear that has accuracy boosting and/or dexterity boosting items.

When it comes to dodging an attack, your skill level in dodging, and your dexterity play a role. Again, you can make up for the lack of dodging levels by having gear that increases the skill bonus for dodging.

Finally, when it comes to blocking we take into account, just your armour class (AC). 

However, if you are the attacker, you are using your base damage stat plus your accuracy bonus to push past their defenses.

Gear that can balance, dexterity, damage stat, accuracy and dodge while increasing your AC, is what you should hope to attain, craft and enchant or purchase from the market board, or – should your looting skill be high enough/you be lucky enough, find off creatures.

**Items are randomly generated when they drop off enemies**

## Other stats matter too

You might think: “ok, I am a Dark Dwarf who is a Vampire. All I need is durability gear.”

While that’s fair, you’ll also need gear that helps your dexterity rise in order to be able to hit anything.

What about intelligence to enchant? Unlike crafting you cannot enchant items if you don’t have the intelligence.

This is where having “sets” of armour and weapons, spells and artifacts as well as rings that boost your primary damage stat, your dexterity and your intelligence will come in handy.

Depending on what you are doing, your gear will affect your stats and skills in some way. 

You are never just a Dark Dwarf with the class of Vampire and the damage stat of durability. You are also a crafter, enchanter, looter of dungeons and so much more (if you want to be).

## Final Note

As a fresh, out of the gate, character, you wont have access to a lot of the gear mentioned. Or the gold to purchase it. There will always be a monster or two, an adventure or two that you can go on to level these skills and find some loot as you level up and get stronger.
