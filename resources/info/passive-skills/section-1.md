# Passive Skills

In Tlessa there are four types of skills that a player can train. There are the two regular types: Training and Crafting and Misc (disenchanting)

and then there are passive skills which you, the player, can train over a series of, wait for it: Hours.

These passive skills add buffs to specific aspects of the game, such as kingdoms and kingdom management and apply even if 
you have no kingdoms, one kingdom or 100 kingdoms.

Passive skills can be trained early game as "in the background" and have a very direct path towards unlocking other passive skills
or "child skills".

When combined passive skills can give mid game to late game characters even more to do, while they [auto farm](/information/automation) [faction](/information/factions) points.

Most of the passive skills, as you can see below, will branch off into other skills that then branch off into other skills giving boosts, reducing costs or unlocking
whole new systems such as the [Blueprint] and [Refinement] process for kingdoms.
