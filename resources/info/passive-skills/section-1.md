# Passive Skills

**Note:** If kingdom management is not something you are interested in, you can freely skip this section of guide as 
1.1.10 only introduced passive skills for Kingdoms at this time.

Tlessa has a set of passive skills that are laid out like a tree that you might be familiar with from other games.

As of 1.1.10, these only focus on Kingdom Management, Take hours to complete and can be trained while the player is 
not online.

We can see our passives if we go to our character sheet and click on the Passive Skills Tab at the bottom in the skills
section:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/passive-skills/images/passive-skills.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/passive-skills/images/passive-skills.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

From there, you will see this:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/passive-skills/images/passive-tree.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/passive-skills/images/passive-tree.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Which will then let you start working your way from the top down. You can click on each name to see the details and what child skills would be unlocked
ad even what the skill it's self does.

As you level these, different side effects such as resource reduction, defence bonuses and even new buildings and units will be unlocked over time.

It is advised that players do not try and max these passive skills out, which cap at level 5 - unless it unlocks a building then it caps at level 1.

Instead, it is advised that players look at the tree, see what they ant from it and work towards that. Later on you can always master the skills or go for others.

If you unlock a building, it will be unlocked for all kingdoms - including newly settled kingdoms. Even if you loose all your kingdoms and settle a new one, 
any unlocked buildings or side effects from the passives will apply, regardless of plane.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> These skills multiply the level by the time needed. So a level 2 skill that states it takes 2 hours, will take 4 hours.
> 
> There is no item you can buy with real world money to unlock these faster. You can also only train one skill at a time.
> Should you cancel a skill that takes 10 hours, and it was 8 hours in, we do not take into account the hours spent when you cancel it.
