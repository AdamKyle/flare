# Races and Classes

-------------------

In Tlessa there are a verity of races and classes that the character can choose from. All of these races and classes affect your base stats, bonus to specific skills and your class determines your base damage stat.

While, for optimal play, you might want to pick a race and class that suit each other, you are free to make any character you want.

Upon leveling up, you will get 2 points in your primary damage stat and 1 point in all other stats automatically.

There are two types of stats: Primary Damage Stat and To Hit Stat. For example, Fighters Primary Damage stat is strength, while their to hit stat is dexterity,
so when you go to buy gear, or enchant gear, you will want enchantments that focus on those two stats.

All shop gear will raise all stats, based on the type of gear. Characters are not limited to the types of gear they can equip except 
class skill special attacks. We will talk more about that in another section called [skills](/information/skills).
