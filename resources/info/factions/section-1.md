## Factions

With in Tlessa there are a specific number of maps (see [planes](/information/planes)). Each map has its own faction
that you have already probably been leveling by just fighting monsters. **Any Monster**. 

The only map in game to not have a faction system is Purgatory.

There is nothing special about Factions, except that they have 4 (technically 5 if you count capped out 4) levels.

This table is the same for all planes. It is imperative that players use [auto battle](/information/automation) and not grind this out manually.

At each stage characters will also be given an item with what's known as a [Randomly Generated Affix](/information/random-enchants). The valuation
of these enchants is 10 billion, later you can pay the Queen of Hearts [npc](/information/npcs) for 50 and 100 billion valuation uniques and even re roll 
them and move them to other items later on. There are a series of [Quests](/information/quests) that you can do to unlock Access to the Queen of Hearts who lives in Hell.

On the [Randomly Generated Affix](/information/random-enchants) page you can read about the stat range for each valuation. While yes the same
affix can generate (same name), it's stats will be vastly different. 

As a result you will never, or very rarely have the same unique as other players in game. A player may only equip one of these at a time and only have one in a
[set](/information/equipment-sets) at a time (although you may have multiple but the set will not be equippable).

A player can get 35 of these "cheap" uniques for doing all the plane factions and capping them out.

Factions also reward the player with a title, the is because some quests can require specific levels of specific factions. The title it's self does nothing for your character.

To cap a faction, a player needs at least 4-6 Hours of [Auto Battling](/information/automation) time.
