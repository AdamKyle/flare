## Factions

With in Tlessa there are a specific number of maps (see [planes](/information/planes)). Each map has its own faction
that you have already probably been leveling by just fighting monsters. **Any Monster**. 

There is nothing special about Factions, except that they have 4 (technically 5 if you count capped out 4) levels.

This table is the same for all planes. It is imperative that players use [auto battle](/information/automation) and not grind this out manually.

At each stage characters will also be given an item with what's known as a [Randomly Generated Affix](/information/random-enchants). The valuation
of these enchants is 1 billion, so the stats are less than if you paid the Queen of Hearts [npc](/information/npcs) for an item.

On the [Randomly Generated Affix](/information/random-enchants) docs page you can read about the stat range for each valuation. While yes the same
affix can generate (same name), it's stats could be vastly different.

These are, or can be, powerful end game enchantments. Players will need special currencies called Hell Shards to be able to not just re-roll
This enchants, or aspects of them, but to also transfer them to the piece of armour or item they want.
