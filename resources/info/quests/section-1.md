Planes of Tlessa has what are called quests which are nothing more than you making sure you have a quest item and/or the currency.

This is also how we gate the user from a lot of features of the game such as [The Queen of Hearts for uniques items](/information/random-enchants),
accessing [Other planes](/information/planes), Getting past level 1000 to the current max level cap, [Holy Items](/information/holy-items) as well as 
[Alchemy](/information/usable-items) as well as other features.

**All quests have explicit instructions on how to access the NPC, what items you need and how to get that item, including what plane, how to access the plane,
what monster to kill, what currencies you need and so on.**

Quests can be completed by speaking with the appropriate [NPC](/information/npcs) and their location. They will take the item and currencies, reward you with either currencies, new item or unlock a skill. Or in some cases â€“ all three.

To see a list of quests click on Plane Quests under the map.

        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/plane-quests.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Clicking this will open a panel:

> ### ATTN!
> 
> This will take a moment the first time you open it. We store the results in your browser cache so that it opens faster next time you open it.
> If the quests are updated, you will see a loading message indicating that it will take a moment to open.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/plane-quests-section.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/plane-quests-section.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Clicking the "All Quests" section in the top right of the panel will open a modal:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/all-quests.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/all-quests.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Any quest that is marked as green is done, any quest marked as blue you can do, and quest marked as red, requires the parent to be done.

Some quests, on the left-hand side, show as a list - these are considered: **One Off Quests**. They can be done in **any** order.

You might see that only two planes exists in the "All Quests" section, and there are 6 planes of existence. Surface has a lot of quests
that take you over various planes of existence, talking to many NPCs.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/surface-quests.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/surface-quests.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see Surface has one: One off Quest and a starting parent quests: I dream of Alchemy (can be done any time)
and Hunting Expedition, which then unlocks a whole mess of quests that start you on your way to unlocking Purgatory - which holds some of the
strongest monsters known and will require you to have access to Purgatory Smiths Work Bench to create [Holy Items](/information/holy-items).

Dungeons, Shadow Plane and Labyrinth, Hell and Purgatory all have quests that are apart-of the Tree of Hunting expedition, but since some of them have no one off or parent quests,
you won't see tabs for them.

Let's see what I mean, click on the quest: Satan's Calling and see this:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/example-quest-npc-info.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/example-quest-npc-info.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

The first tab is the NPC details. On the left we have where the NPC is, what plane, their command to enter and how to message them.

If the NPC is not on the surface, like this one, we give you the details of EXACTLY how to reach this NPC.

The best way to complete the "how to access" section, is to read from the top down, but start bottom up. So for example, your first thing to do is kill Labyrinth Fiend,
to get the Key of Labyrinth, which lets you traverse to Labyrinth.

Now you have to complete a quest called Light the way, if you look the modal image above, you see this quest is Under Map the Unseen, which requires you to complete
Hunting Expedition. See how they are all connected?

Clicking on the Required to Complete Tab:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/required-to-complete.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/required-to-complete.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

The first sub tab will show the basics, clicking on each other the other tabs will show you exactly how to get them. For example the first Required item is Satan's Hide,
how do we get that? Click the Item Requirements tab:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/item-requirements.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/item-requirements.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You can also see the quests rewards:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/reward-data.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/reward-data.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

This way a player never has to leave the game to see what quests they can do to get what.

When players first open the quest panel, it can take a while to load. We have a lot of data to fetch in relation to how every quest is connected to every other quest.

However, we store this data in your browser cache, so the next time you open the panel, all we have to fetch is weather you have new completed quests or not.

This panel will not update in real time when you complete a quest. You must close and open the quest panel again to see new unlocked quests.

This data will persist between logins, the only way you will have to fetch all the quest data again is if I, The Creator, add new or change quests or you,
the player clear your browser cache or reinstall your OS.
