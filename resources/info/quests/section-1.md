Planes of Tlessa has what are called quests which are nothing more than you making sure you have a quest item and/or the currency.

Quests can be completed by speaking with the appropriate [npc]() and their location. They will take the item and currencies, reward you with either currencies, new item or unlock a skill. Or in some cases – all three.

To get started, lets look at an example quest: I dream of Alchemy (See table below for the quest).
