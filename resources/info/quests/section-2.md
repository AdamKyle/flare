Let's first see what we need in I dream of Alchemy. Go ahead and click the link above to see what we need to do to unlock the skill.

All done? Great! So we need to kill a Celestial Treasure Goblin to get Alchemist Tools to then trade to this [NPC](/information/npcs) via 
being at their location and typing `/m NPCName: Quest`, you’ll replace NPCName with the actual name of the NPC.

As you noticed, the Alchemist Tools have a 25% chance to drop! It also requires some gold and gold dust to conjure. 
So first we need to either train crafting and enchanting to enchant some low level items we can then disenchant from our 
inventory, or we have to go to the market board and purchase some cheap items to disenchant.

We could also just farm adventures and fight monsters for drops.

Got some gold Dust? Great, lets conjure the [Celestial Entity](/information/celstials)!

Now that we have defeated the Celestial Entity and got the reward (this could take a few tries for you as it is a 25% drop) lets turn it in.

First message the npc to see where they are, in this example they are at:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/find-npc.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/find-npc.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Next move to them, yes you have to be at their exact coordinates.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/at-location.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/at-location.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Next message them. Look at that! We unlocked a new skill!

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/quests/images/completed-quest.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/quests/images/completed-quest.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

That’s all there is to quest. 

If you now head over to your character sheet, you will see that Alchemy is no longer locked. We also see that, under Craft/Enchant in 
the actions section, Alchemy.

Alchemy will require you to disenchant gear to get Gold Dust and kill more Celestials to get shards.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> If a npc has multiple quests, and some do, you will have to speak the NPC again, to complete each additional quest.
