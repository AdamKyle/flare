## Different Types of Enchants

Starting in 1.1.8, Tlessa introduced a few new types of enchantments that players can apply to their items.

These enchantments descriptions will clearly tell you the type of enchantment and how it works.

## Enemies can resist these

Every enemy, be it a dropdown critter or a Celestial has a chance to resist affixes. That is, any of these 
(with exception to class bonus), could be resisted - meaning it does no damage or doesn't apply the effect.

Critters in the dropdown list will have much lower chances to resist, while Celestials could have a much higher chance.

To get around this, Tlessa introduced a new Quest that allows you to purchase an item that will prevent all your affixes from being resisted.

There are a couple of damage based affixes (further down) that can't be resisted.

## Class Bonus Affixes

These do not stack. Having multiple of the same type of affix will not increase your class bonus any higher.

Instead, if you have multiple, we will take the highest % value affix and use that.

You can see a list of these below.
