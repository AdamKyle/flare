### Entrancing

These affixes have a chance to entrance the enemy. They fire after stat reduction affixes and before
any other attack is done.

These do not stack and we will take the best of the many you might have equipped.

If these are successful, your enemy will not be able to dodge OR block. Your attack will land. Other affixes, spells and so
on can be resisted, but your weapon cannot be blocked or miss.

The enemy can then attack on their turn - the entrancing effect only lasts for your turn.

Below are a list of affixes that entrance the enemy.
