### Life Stealing Affixes

These affixes steal life from the enemy. There is a trick to these affixes though, they are best suited for vampires.

The reason for that is because, if your character is a vampire these affixes have a chance (that is, they are not resisted) to fire during your attack along with your other affixes
and again after the enemy attacks, assuming you or the enemy are not dead.

For other classes, these affixes will only fire after the enemies turn, assuming you or the enemy are not dead.

Below is a list of life stealing affixes.
