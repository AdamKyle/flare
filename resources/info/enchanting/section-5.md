### Stat Reduction

These affixes can and cannot stack.

The prefix versions do not stack, and instead of taking the best one, we take the first one we find on your gear.

The suffix versions do stack. You can have multiple different types or multiple of the same type.

These Affixes fire before any other affix and before the monster's health is determined and can be resisted, 
unless you have the right quest item.

You can see a list of stat reducing affixes below (including both suffix and prefix)
