# Enchanting

Enchanting, like crafting, is also meant to be easy. There is, however, a slight difference in how its works.

    </a>
</div>

To enchant an item:

1. Select the item
2. Select either prefix or suffix or both.
3. Click enchant.

When enchanting items, you are training the enchanting skill. This skill has a max level of 400 and gives 0.25% per level as a bonus to succeed.

At level 400, with no additional modifiers from equipment or items, you will have a success chance of 99%.

## Existing Affixes (Enchantments)

If the item already has an enchantment on it, for each additional enchantment the item has an additional ten seconds will be added to the default ten seconds.

> If the item already has an enchantment on it, the cost to replace will be 1000 gold + New Affix Cost. 

For example if a Rusty Bloody Broken Dagger has a suffix on it, and you are attempting to replace the suffix, you will receive a 20-second time out. However, if you wanted to add a prefix it would be 10 second timeout.

If, however, you are attempting to replace two enchantments on an item, it will be a 30-second timeout.

Each additional 10 seconds is for the disenchanting or removal of previous enchantment which is done automatically for you when you succeed.

For each affix, you roll to see if you can enchant. Your roll is the Enchanting skill bonus along with any other relevant bonus. 

If you fail to enchant the item, weather is be with one enchant or two, the item and the gold required to do so are lost for ever. 

This is where it gets dicey for low level characters who have a low level enchanting skill and want to attach two 
enchantments to an item because if they apply the first enchantment and fail to apply the second, the gold and item are lost.

There are a set of items and Enchantments as well as quest items that can help increase this chance to enchant at lower levels.

## Pay Attention To Chat

Here are some examples of messages that can appear:

**Chat is read bottom up**

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/enchanting/images/fail-to-enchant.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/enchanting/images/fail-to-enchant.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

In the above, you can see that you have failed to enchant the item.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/enchanting/images/too-easy.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/enchanting/images/too-easy.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

In the above image you can see that the enchantments are too easy to, thus you get no exp for enchanting this item.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/enchanting/images/one-enchantment-is-too-easy.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/enchanting/images/one-enchantment-is-too-easy.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

One enchantment is level appropriate for your enchanting level, however the other is too easy, you will only get xp for level appropriate enchantment.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> When referring to, too easy to craft ..., what this means is that one or both enchantments are too easy for you at the current level of enchanting.
> As you gain levels in enchanting you get new affixes unlocked. All affixes have a max level before they become too easy.

## Requirements for enchanting

All you need is the gold, the items and the time to level. Enchanting can be an interesting gold sink as more and more enchantments get added to the game. 

Enchantments are meant to be expensive, as they can add significant advantage in overcoming difficult enemies or adventures, crafting harder items and enchanting items.

Enchantments can also give bonuses to skills, be they battle based skills or crafting or enchanting skills.

## Cost to enchant

The cost is: The enchantment cost + half the original cost of the already attached enchantment.

That is, if you have an item with one enchantment, and you want to replace it, it will be:

The cost of the enchantment you want (ie, 1000) + half the cost of the enchantment to be replaced (ie, 500) for a total of 1500.

Enchanted items cannot be sold via the shop. 

They can be destroyed or sold on the [market]() board. This provides a great way for the player to make some money.

## Stacking on and non stacking Enchants.

Some high level enchants that can void, do damage, life steal and or raise stats - might state they do not stack.
What this means is particular aspects will not stack and those are documented on the enchantment themselves.

Let's take: Mages Golden Demonic Aspiration as an example.

This enchants is a high level enchant that costs 1 billion per enchant. This enchantment is the best there is for Heretics.

For a mage, the life stealing aspect will not stack. The Damage does not already stack. So you might be thinking, why would I want two of these if the 
Life stealing and the Damage does not stack? Because the stats do. If you search for this item in the enchanting list below, you will see three tabs:

- Base information
- Stats
- Skills

These three tabs **WILL** stack. If the damage was stackable, it would also stack. If you were a caster vampire with a high intelligence gear,
you would want many of these for the life stacking.

Make sure to investigate an enchantment that states it won't stack for any stackable information. For example 14 of these Enchantments
on your gear would bring your modded intelligence 2800% higher. As a caster you would want this to do ungodly damage.

## Enemies can resist damage

Every enemy has a chance to resist your damaging affixes, specifically the ones who state their damage is not irresistible.
If the damage is not irresistible, but can stack - the enemy has a chance to completely evade this damage.

If the damage is irresistible, regardless of if it can stack or not, the enemy cannot - ever - resist this. Your damage may fluctuate
if you have both stacking and non stacking damage affixes as the enemy can evade the non-irresistible damage reducing the total damage to that of just 
stacking.

## Class Bonus Affixes

These do not stack. Having multiple of the same type of affix will not increase your class bonus any higher.

Instead, if you have multiple, we will take the highest % value affix and use that.


## Life Stealing Affixes

These affixes steal life from the enemy. There is a trick to these affixes though, they are best suited for vampires.

The reason for that is because, if your character is a vampire these affixes have a chance (that is, they are not voided) to fire during your attack along with your other affixes
and again after the enemy attacks, assuming you or the enemy are not dead.

For other classes, these affixes will only fire after the enemies turn, assuming you or the enemy are not dead.

## Stat Reduction

These affixes can and cannot stack.

The prefix versions do not stack, and instead of taking the best one, we take the **first one** we find on your gear.

The suffix versions do stack. You can have multiple different types or multiple of the same type.

These Affixes fire before any other affix and before the monster's health is determined and can be voided,
unless you have the right quest item or an affix that prevents voiding.

## Entrancing

These affixes have a chance to entrance the enemy. They fire after stat reduction affixes and before
any other attack is done.

These do not stack. We will **take the best** of the many you might have equipped.

If these are successful, your enemy will not be able to dodge OR block. Your attack will land. Other affixes, spells and so
on can be resisted, but your weapon cannot be blocked or miss.

The enemy can then attack on their turn - the entrancing effect only lasts for your turn.
