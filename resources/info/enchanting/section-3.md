### Damage Affixes

These can and cannot stack depending on what the affix states.

Higher level Affixes, around level 80 or so, will have irresistible damage, that is damage that cannot be resisted by an enemy regardless of
its resistance %.

If you have multiple of these enchantments equipped, we will take the strongest of them all and use that.

These affixes fire before any other attack is done.

Below are a list of the current damage dealing affixes.
