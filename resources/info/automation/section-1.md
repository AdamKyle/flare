# Automation

Tlessa has introduced and will continue to introduce three types of Automation. One, at the time of this writing, has been implemented with
the other two to follow in later patches.

Right now the three types are:

- Attack Automation
- Crafting Automation (Coming)
- Kingdom Management Automation (Coming)

Tlessa is not, nor will it ever be, a set it and forget it type of game. That's why this is not true automation.
There is one rule that applies to all three types of automation: **You just be logged in**. Once your session expires,
or you log out, the automation will stop.

Automation was never designed to make Tlessa a set it and forget it type of game, instead it is designed to enahnce the play experience,
while keeping you engaged and taking away some "tedious" aspects.

## Attack Automation

Characters will be able to select a monster, a length of time, if we should move down the list and what skill to train
while the fight process is happening.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/automation/images/attack-automation.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/automation/images/attack-automation.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see that you can select the monster and the attack type, but before you can begin we have some
questions on the advanced tab, only one is required: Length.

<div class="mb-4">

        <img src="/storage/info/automation/images/advanced-attack-automation.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can select the skill to train while auto attacking, the length of the auto attack in hours and weather or not the auto attack should move
down the monster list every x levels.

Once satisfied, you can begin the fight.

There are some things you cannot do:

- You won't be able to teleport, set sail or traverse.
- You won't be able to wage war or use items on kingdoms.
- You won't be able to apply or cancel boons from [alchemical](/information/usable-items) items.
- You won't be able to shop or visit the [market board](/information/market-board).
- You won't be able to manage [equipment](/information/equipment) or [sets](/information/equipment-sets). (There are some exceptions)
- You won't be able to use /PCT to instantly Teleport to [Celestials](/information/celestials).
- You won't be able to visit [special location](/information/special-locations).
- You cannot train skills. (There are some exceptions)

> ## ATTN!

> Auto Battle will not take into account any Fight Timeout modifiers you have. it's a flat 10 seconds each battle. This is because there is a chance for auto battle

> 
> A player does not need to fear anything or fret, their rewards will still come in, it could just take much longer depending on how long you let auto battle run for.

The exceptions to equipment is that you can still disenchant drops, craft/enchant and move items between sets, but you cannot equip items, replace equipped items or 
equip a new set, unequipped a set or unequipped currently equipped items.

Regarding skills, while you cannot switch which skill is training or even set one while this automation is running, you can still train your [Passive skills](/information/kingdom-passive-skills).

Your character can select the maximum amount of time which is 8 hours. Should you manage to do a full eight hours of auto attacking,
without dying or loosing your session (that is being kicked after 90 minutes of no activity) you will be locked out of doing 
another auto attack session for the rest of the day.

At the end of the day the auto attack lock on your account will be removed.

> ## ATTN!
> 
> This only applies if you do a full continuous, uninterrupted 8 hours. Doing 1 hour here, 4 hours there and 6 hours later in the day
> does **NOT** apply to your 8-hour limit cap.

Auto attack is the only automation with said restriction around length.

Should you die, this will stop, Should you log out, or your session die after 90 minutes of inactivity, this will stop.

You will want to use Auto battle for [Factions](/information/factions) to get rare and unique enchanted items.
