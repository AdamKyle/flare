## Skill Break Down

Let's break down what's all in a skill, you can see this information by clicking on a skill above:

- **Base Damage Modifier**: This affects your core damage. If a skill increments this, then it is calculated into the damage done to the creature at the time of the attack, assuming the attack landed successfully.
- **Base Healing Modifier**: This affects your healing amount when you use spells to heal. In battle these spells will trigger automatically assuming you have a healing spell equipped.
- **Base AC Modifier**: This affects your defense. This affects weather you block an attack or not. This combined with your base AC is used to determine if the monster can do damage.

> ### ATTN!
>
> You will see these throughout this guide. These three modifier attributes can also exist on artifacts, quest items, enchanted items and even regular items themselves.

- **Fight Timeout Modifier**: With every kill, comes a timeout of 10 seconds, 20 if the enemy has killed you. These modifiers take a specific percentage off your timer. [Learn more about timers](/information/time-gates)
- **Skill Bonus Per Level**: The percentage bonus applied per level up (to a maximum of 99.00%)

> ### ATTN!
> 
> If a skill makes use of the above-mentioned modifiers, it will receive no skill bonus per level, instead the bonus to those modifiers will increase.

When viewing your character sheet, you will see a list of skills. Each one of those skills can be clicked on to get relevant details about said skill and about where you are in training that skill. (see image below).

## Class Skills

There are some skills that are class based only. Some might have restrictions like a Prophet needing Healing spells equipped in order to get their bonus.
These skills mostly increase the damage, the fight timeout, the healing and/or the armour class bonus.

Each class has one, and you can see what your class skill is by visiting the [Races and Classes](/information/races-and-classes) documentation and viewing your selected class.
This will tell you what your class skill is.

Every class skill has what's called a "special ability." All of these, except Prophets class skill special ability, do damage.

- Fighters Double Damage - Lets the fighter attack again
- Thieves Shadow Dance - Let the thieves dance through the shadows (your attack can be unavoidable)
- Rangers Triple Attack - Notch the arrow and attack three times
- Heretics Double Cast - Cast again
- Prophets Double Heal - Heal again
- Vampires Blood Thirst - Steal additional health from the enemy.

These all fire based on your class bonus, which starts at 5%. There are [enchantments](/information/enchanting) that will raise this
and gve your special more of a chance to hit.

The class skill specials fire automatically on their own.

## Training skills

When it comes to training skills there are two ways to train: **Fight** or **Craft**. That's it.

There are [Passive](/information/kingdom-passive-skills) skills that one can train, however, for the purpose of this document we will not focus on those.

Passive skills are essentially skills that you would train in the background while playing the game or while logged out and over hours they will unlock
a new level with new passive bonuses, buffs and unlocked content.

> There is no item you can buy with real world money or any form of currency to allow this process
> to go faster for one player over another. You want a level 999 looting skill to (almost) always be getting loot? Earn it.
>
> There is also no way, aside from [adventures](/information/adventure) (for fight based skills only), to train these via idling.

If a skill can be trained, you can head to your character sheet and click train on the desired skill. 

<a href="/storage/info/skill-information/images/training-skills.png" class="glightbox">
    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/training-skills.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

From here you can decide how much XP you are willing to sacrifice per fight to train that skill. You sacrifice as little as 10% to a maximum of 100%. All skills are xp based.


<a href="/storage/info/skill-information/images/skill-training.png" class="glightbox">
    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/skill-training.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

As you fight you will train that skill over time.

**The more XP you put towards a skill, the less you get in return to level. For example, putting 100% into Looting means all battle (even adventure) XP goes towards that skill.**

For crafting skills, you have to physically craft items of that type. For example on the game page, you can click Craft/Enchant actions and select craft. From there you can select the type of item to craft and then the item its self. [Learn more about Crafting](/information/crafting).

<a href="/storage/info/skill-information/images/crafting-skills.png" class="glightbox">
    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/crafting-skills.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

You can also check out [Enchanting](/information/enchanting) for more details.

As you craft items you will train your crafting skill for that type. Over time, you'll get new items of that type to craft.

As you enchant it's the same thing, however you'll get more enchantments (or Affixes) to attach on the item.

Finally, the last set of skills, for ths section, is the Misc. Skills:

<a href="/storage/info/skill-information/images/misc-skills.png" class="glightbox">
    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/misc-skills.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

There is only one, [Disenchanting](/information/disenchanting). As you disenchant items, you can get a [currency](/information/currencies) known as Gold Dust.

This currency can be used in [Quests](/information/quests) and a new skill called: [Alchemy](/information/usable-items).

As you disenchant items, you will gain XP towards disenchanting which results in fewer failures when disenchanting. Combined with your looting skill, you can get a lot
of drops and thus a lot of Gold Dust.

This will also level, albeit at half the XP, your enchanting skill making it easier to enchant higher end enchantments on to gear.

### XP and Training Skills

As we learned, training skills are skills which you sacrifice some of your Xp towards to level. The difference between Crafting Skills and Training skills is that
with training skills the XP needed to get to the next level increases over time.

The formula for this growth is simple: Skill level * 100 = xp needed for next level. For example, at level 10 you need 1000 XP.

To help with leveling skills, there are [Enchantments](/information/enchanting) and other items that have boosts towards skill XP including quests that you can do from an [NPC](/information/npcs) called
The Helpless Goblin that can upgrade found items to better ones giving more XP per kill.

Next, to help, we increase the XP given at specific stages: 25 as a base for levels 1-10, 100 as a base for levels 10-100, 500 for levels 100-500 and finally 750 for levels 500-999.

Add your bonuses on top of this, and you can easily get ~6k XP per kill starting at level 500. Which is still a grind, but not a bad one if you do it with [Exploration](/information/exploration).

> When you are training a skill, you are effectively using that skill. However, when it comes to skills that are affecting things like looting or 
> attacking, such as increasing your Base Damage with a modifier, the levels and time you put in those specific skills will automatically be applied
> even if you are not actively training that skill.
>
> For example if you start training Looting, after putting 5 levels into Accuracy, when you go to attack those five levels (of Accuracy) will be taken into account 
> when determining if you can hit or not automatically. This makes training multiple skills to their max level beneficial for creating optimized characters.

## Leveling Skills

When you are fighting, and your skill levels up, you'll see it popup in chat.

If you are doing an adventure, and you have logged out and have a skill training, you will see the new level when you collect your rewards from that adventure, assuming you have successfully completed the adventure and that the adventure rewards enough xp to level the skill.

For adventures, their skill XP and XP will overflow. So you could gain multiple levels both character and skill wise, from a single Adventure.

[Learn more about adventuring](/information/adventure).

## XP and Crafting skills

As we saw with training skills, the xp and the xp you are rewarded will scale with you as you level. However, crafting XP is different. This is a random number between 100 and 350
and without bonuses from gear, your base is 20 XP per successful craft, enchant (doubled if you do two and are successful) or use alchemy or disenchant.
