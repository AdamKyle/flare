## Skill Break Down

Let's break down what's all in a skill, you can see this information by clicking on a skill above:

- **Base Damage Modifier**: This affects your core damage. If a skill increments this, then it is calculated into the damage done to the creature at the time of the attack, assuming the attack landed successfully.
- **Base Healing Modifier**: This affects your healing amount when you use spells to heal. In battle these spells will trigger automatically assuming you have a healing spell equipped.
- **Base AC Modifier**: This affects your defense. This affects weather you block an attack or not. This combined with your base AC is used to determine if the monster can do damage.

> ### ATTN!

> You will see these throughout this guide. These three modifier attributes can also exist on artifacts, quest items, enchanted items and even regular items them selves.

- **Fight Timeout Modifier**: With every kill, comes a timeout of 10 seconds, 20 if the enemy has killed you. These modifiers take a specific percentage off your timer. [Learn more about timers](/information/time-gates)
- **Skill Bonus Per Level**: The percentage bonus applied per level up (to a maximum of 99.00%)

> ### ATTN!
> 
> If a skill makes use of the above-mentioned modifiers, it will receive no skill bonus per level, instead the bonus to those modifiers will increase.
> 
> Monsters can also have skills that affect these modifiers as well.

When viewing your character skeet, you will see a list of skills. Each one of those skills can be clicked on to get relevant details about said skill and about where you are in training that skill. (see image below).

## Class Skills

There are some skills that are class based only. Some might have restrictions like a Prophet needing Healing spells equipped in order to get their bonus.
These skills mostly increase the damage, the fight timout, the healing and/or the armour class bonus.

## Training skills

When it comes to training skills there are two ways to train: **Fight** or **Craft**. Thats it.

> There is also no way, aside from [adventures](/information/adventure) (for fight based skills only), to train these via idling.

If a skill can be trained, you can head to your character sheet and click train on the desired skill.

</a>

From here you can decide how much XP you are willing to sacrifice per fight to train that skill. You sacrifice as little as 10% to a maximum of 100%. All skills are xp based.

</a>

As you fight you will train that skill over time.

**The more XP you put towards a skill, the less you get in return to level. For example, putting 100% into Looting means all battle (even adventure) XP goes towards that skill.**

For crafting skills, you have to physically craft items of that type. For example on the game page, you can click Craft/Enchant actions and select craft. From there you can select the type of item to craft and then the item its self. [Learn more about Crafting](/information/crafting).

You can also checkout [Enchanting](/information/enchanting) for more details.

As you craft items you will train your crafting skill for that type. Over time, you'll get new items of that type to craft.

As you enchant it's the same thing, however you'll get more enchantments (or Affixes) to attach on the item.

> When you are training a skill, you are effectively using that skill. How ever, when it comes to skills that are affecting things like looting or 
> attacking, such as increasing your Base Damage with a modifier, the levels and time you put in those specific skills will automatically be applied
> even if you are not actively training that skill.
>
> For example if you start training Looting, after putting 5 levels into Accuracy, when you go to attack those five levels (of Accuracy) will be taken into account 
> when determining if you can hit or not automatically. This makes training multiple skills to their max level beneficial for creating optimized characters.

## Leveling Skills

When you are fighting, and your skill levels up, you'll see it popup in chat.

If you are doing an adventure, and you have logged out and have a skill training, you will see the new level when you collect your rewards from that adventure, assuming you have successfully completed the adventure and that the adventure rewards enough xp to level the skill.

[Learn more about adventuring](/information/adventure).

## Skill XP

When a skill levels there are two ways the next level xp is calculated. That is the xp needed to go fro level 2-3 for example.

- **For skills that can be trained**: This value is between 100 and 150 xp needed to level the skill.
- **For crafting skills**: This value is between 100 and 200xp needed to level that skill.

## Lots of skills, what do I focus on?

You might feel overwhelmed with the amount of skills you csn train, the fact that you can only train one at a time, unless you are crafting or enchanting or such.

The best place to start is train your class skills for a bit, before upping accuracy. From there, it depends on what you want. To fight faster? To craft better gear?
