Let’s recruit some basic spearmen. Just like with buildings, you can click the row in the table for the unit you want to recruit:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/recruitment-modal.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/recruitment-modal.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As we can see, we have a slider for how many spearmen you want to recruit. You also see your current population.

Let’s select some spearmen:

> ### ATTN!
>
> You can only recruit as many units as you have population and resources. The numbers in unit cost section of the modal will go up as you select more. If the numbers go red, you will not be able to recruit as you don’t have the resources. If they go green, you will be able to recruit the units.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/recruitment-selected.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/recruitment-selected.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As we can see, we can recruit some of these spearmen because the unit cost is all green. You also notice that the attack and defence will also increase as a calculation of total units * one unit’s defence and attack.

We can see how much population this will be required, we also see the time that it will take. The more you recruit the longer it takes.

We also can see that these are defender-based units. They can be sent off to attack, more on that later.

When we are ready to recruit, we can click Recruit Selected beside the slider. If the recruit button is disabled, that means our unit cost has some red in it, and that means we don’t have the resources to recruit the amount we want.

We can cancel a recruitment the same way we do for buildings (by clicking unit queue at the top of the kingdom management modal and clicking on the unit you want to cancel in the table).

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-queue.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-queue.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

The same rules apply, it’s the time from you clicked the recruit, to the time it finished with the amount of time left. If the amount, percentage wise, is less than 10% you won’t be able to cancel because you are almost done.

Just like for buildings you will only get a percentage of resources back based on the time left.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/cancel-recruitment.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/cancel-recruitment.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

If you are not logged in, and you have multiple units in queue, as they finish, you’ll get an email for each one that finished. Again, you can turn this off in the settings page. If you are logged in the chat will update to show you how many total units, you have now when that unit is finished. If you previously recruited 100 spearmen, and then recruit another 100, you’ll see chat update to tell you that you now have 200 spearmen.

## Regarding timers

All timers are server side with client-side representations. You are free to logout, move away from the kingdom, go on adventures, craft, go manage other kingdoms and so on. These timers will process in the background for you.

## Managing multiple kingdoms.

In order to manage your many kingdoms, as they grow – The creator decided not to allow you to
have an overall kingdom management section. Instead, you must physically move to your kingdoms.
This is why a lot of people will end up settling kingdoms next to each other, eventually creating what are called plexes.

> ### ATTN!
>
> Plexes is a term borrowed from racewarkingdoms, this is where you have, for example: 50 kingdoms (or less) in a square or a line. Usually a giant square filled in with kingdoms.

You can always get back to a kingdom by teleporting to it. Click on the kingdom on the map and click teleport - assuming you can move and have the gold.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/teleport.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/teleport.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>


## Attacking other kingdoms

We will discuss this in further detail in the attacking section of this guide, however, as you noticed your kingdoms show up for you and only you on the map:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/map.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/map.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

To find another person’s kingdom, you must travel around the map. Once you find another person’s kingdom, you’ll see an attack button appear in the action section:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/attack-action.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/attack-action.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You won’t see their kingdom on the map, but this button indicates you found someone’s kingdom and can attack it. More on that in the [Attacking a kingdom](/information/attacking-kingdoms) section.

## Embezzling

When it comes to embezzling the gold from your kingdom, you can click the treasury link at the top of the kingdom management window. From here you can embezzle any amount of treasure that you currently have which accumulates per hour.

Every time you embezzle, regardless of how much, your kingdom will lose 15% morale. If your kingdom is at
or below the 15% morale threshold or has no treasure to embezzle you will not be able to embezzle from your
kingdom.

If your kingdom is taken, by another player, your treasury will be lost and given to them in their new kingdom.

## Additional Tips

- Settling one kingdom is free, settling additional kingdoms cost 10,000 gold per kingdom you own. For example, if you have 5 kingdoms,
  your 6th will cost 50,000 gold. If you don’t have the gold, you can Attack other kingdoms, reduce their morale to
  0 and send in a special unit called a “settler” who will settle the kingdom. See [Attacking a kingdom](/information/attacking-kingdoms).

- Kingdoms that do not get walked for five days are handed over to the [NPC Kingdom Holder](/information/npc-kingdoms).

- You can use [special items on kingdoms to attack them](/information/items-and-kingdoms).
