## Morale

Morale affects your kingdom in a few ways.

- If the Kingdom morale is 0% and the [NPC kingdom holder](/information/npc-kingdoms) has not taken the kingdom, you will gain: current population + 30
- If the Farms durability is at 0, you will gain 1/2 the buildings increase in population. That is instead of 150, you would get 75.
- If none of the above apply, you will get the full population increase per hour.

## Units

Now that we have upgraded a building, let's discuss units.

Within kingdom management you can click Unit Recruitment beside the Buildings at the bottom:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-table.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-table.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You might be thinking: Where are all my units, I only have one unit.

Thatâ€™s because you need to upgrade the barracks, at specific levels you can gain more units to recruit. See the unit table below:
