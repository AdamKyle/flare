One of the key aspects of Planes of Tlessa is to allow you to settle kingdoms. Kingdoms in Tlessa work differently than other kingdom management games you might have played or are used to. With some similarities but my own spin on it.

Borrowing the idea of settling kingdoms from a game I used to play way back when. I have made some changes to way they work here.

First, to settle a kingdom you simply move to any location that is not a port or special location. You’ll know if you can 
settle a kingdom by seeing this button appear in the actions section:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-action.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-action.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

From here you may click Settle Kingdom, this will open a popup:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-modal.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-modal.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You’ll type in a name. Kingdom names must be between 5 and 30 characters. You may use spaces in the kingdom name.


> ### ATTN!

> You may not settle a kingdom within 1 movement of any location or port. That is, for ports and locations, move up two spaces 
> and you can settle a kingdom. This is help players see ports and locations on the map.

> ## Multiple Kingdoms?

> Should you already have one kingdom on the plane you settled on, additional kingdoms will cost you gold.

>        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/additional-cost.png" class="img-fluid" />
>    </a>
> </div>

> Each plane allows you to settle one kingdom for free, to settle additional kingdoms you must either take 
> another kingdom or pay.

> **Calculation of cost**: Total Kingdoms owned * 10,000 gold. (ie, 6 kingdoms, 60,000 gold to settle a seventh).
> 
> There is no way to use real world money to get additional kingdoms.

> ## Kingdoms Show up on the map

> When you or someone else settles a kingdom, you will see the map update with their kingdom, which is shown in red on the map.

>        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/kingdoms-on-map.png" class="img-fluid" />
>    </a>
> </div>
>
> As you can see, there is a blue icon for your kingdom (under the player (the orange man)), and a red icon for enemy kingdoms
>
> Clicking on any of the red kingdom icons will show you:

> <div class="mb-4">
>    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/enemy-kingdom-details.png" class="glightbox">
>        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/enemy-kingdom-details.png" class="img-fluid" />
>    </a>
> </div>
>
> All enemy kingdoms are red by default across all planes.

Once that’s done, you’ll click settle and from there a new modal window will popup:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/kingdom-management-modal.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/kingdom-management-modal.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see, we start by listing your resources along with basic information about your kingdom including resources gained per hour, morale gained/lost per hour and so on.

You can at any time, rename your kingdom.

Under that information, there are two tabs: Buildings and Units.

You can click on the row in the table to see the details of what it costs to upgrade a building as well as what you’ll gain from upgrading that building including time to upgrade the building. The higher the level the more time it takes as well as resources.

Some buildings such as keep, walls, farm and barracks will cause your kingdom to lose morale per hour if they fall to a durability of zero.

For example, lets upgrade our Keep (you can scroll the modal down, as not all the details may fit o the screen):

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see the current durability and current defence as well as current level. Next, we have how much morale this building will give you per hour and how much you will lose per hour should the durability fall to zero.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> You can click and drag the modal, by clicking and dragging the title, this way you can see what resources you have in comparison to what you need, in this case we have the resources, indicated by the: Can Upgrade being yes.
> 
> You may only upgrade a building up one level at a time. You must wait for that building to finish upgrading before queueing it for the next level.

The cost in resources also goes up per level.

In this case we need a specific number of resources, including population.

Under the cost section is what changes to the building including any additional resources per hour. Since walls are not a resource building, we gain nothing there, but our defence and durability do go up.

One thing you might notice about the above image is a bunch of negative numbers. You might be looking at yours and wondering how do I get these negative reductions?

You can train your [Passive](/information/kingdom-passive-skills) which can effect your kingdom from resource reduction to unlocking new buildings, more on that in a moment.

You can also train your Kingmanship ([Skills](/information/skills)) to reduce the time required to upgrade/rebuild buildings ad recruit units.

Passives can take hours and Kingmanship can take a few hours to get a to a decent level to see reductions on time.

> ### ATTN!

> Numbers shown in the images may not reflect in game values.

Notice how you had a building queue and unit queue tab? Let’s click on the building queue tab:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-queue.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-queue.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see our building is upgrading, if we click the row in the table for that building:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-cancel.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-cancel.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

**Wait, did I see that you use gold to upgrade buildings?**

Yes you did child, let me show you:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/gold-upgrade-building.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/gold-upgrade-building.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can select the amount of levels you want, things like building cost reduction, population cost reduction (both from Passives) 
as well as time reduction (from Kingmanship) will be applied here.

Each building, much like each unit - as we will see later, will have its own cost which is displayed in this section of the upgrade 
section. The only time you cannot use gold to upgrade, is when the building must be repaired.

Canceling a gold investment upgrade will only get you a specific amount of resources back, as shown n the above cancellation window.

When we enter a level:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/gold-upgrade-level-buildings.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/gold-upgrade-level-buildings.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You can see the values change, and we tell you what level the building will go to. You might also see the warning about population, this is an additional
cost that can be applied and is not given back, should you choose to cancel the building upgrade, nor is the population given back to you.

This only holds true for gold related upgrades, if you use resources and cancel you will get some population back.

You can see we can cancel the building; we can do the same thing for units in the unit queue.

> ## ATTN!
>
> Canceling a building takes the time it started and the time it will complete as well as the time left to calculate how many resources, including population, percentage wise, you’ll get back. If the building is almost done upgrading you won’t be able to cancel because the builder is almost done, and you would get less then 10% materials back.
>
> You will see a notice if you attempt to cancel when you have, for example a few minutes or seconds left.

Once the building is done, assuming you are logged in you’ll see it in chat:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-chat.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-chat.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

If you are not logged in, you’ll receive an email.

> ### ATTN!
>
> If you have multiple buildings in queue and you logout, you’ll receive multiple emails when they are finished, one for each building that finishes when its finished. You can turn this off in the settings page.

The same will happen for units (see below).

When your kingdom gains resources per hour you’ll see:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/resource-chat.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/resource-chat.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

In the chat section. However, for your own sanity, I have made the choice to turn off the email notification for you. You can in the [Settings]()
section turn this back on. If you turn it on, you will get one email per hour (if you are not logged in) of all the kingdoms that had their resources updated.
We do not show you the list of new resource values for those kingdoms, just present you a table with kingdom, location and that it was updated.

Resources are gained once per hour.

## Abandoning Your Kingdom

After you settle your kingdom, you will see a new button called Abandon Kingdom. Clicking this will show you the following modal:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/abandoning-kingdoms.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/abandoning-kingdoms.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

head this modal well, for this a penalty for recklessly abandoning your kingdoms. You cannot abandon a kingdom if:

- You have units in movement or units are moving towards your kingdom.
- You have Gold Bars in your kingdom (these are worth 2 billion each and would be a waste of gold).

You will be locked out for 30 minutes from attempting to settle another kingdom, take a kingdom through npc actions or war.

Should you abandon another kingdom in that 30 minute lock out window, you will in cure another 30 minute time out on top of the remaining time you have left.

There is nowhere in game to see this timeout. You will be told of the time left when you attempt to settle another kingdom or wage war and 
attempt to take one, or if you attempt to use NPC commands to take one.
