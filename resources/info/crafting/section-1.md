# Crafting

Crafting in Tlessa is simple and designed to be that way. The first thing to know is you have a set of skills specifically designed for crafting.

You don't have to gather anything or spend time training these skills in battle. These skills are trained by physically crafting the item.

You will craft at least 10 to a maximum of 20 items with no bonuses before being able to gain a level.

>  Low level crafting is RNG based. There will be times you fail more than succeed. This is because, each crafting skill
> has a crafting bonus that starts at 0%. Additional levels increase this by .25%. There is equipment in game that you can buy from the
> shop and affixes you can enchant onto items to increase this bonus at lower levels to give you more of a shot at crafting the item.

Failing to craft the item will cost you the gold you need to craft the item, and you'll get no experience points.

**The crafting skills are:**

All Crafting skills have a max level of 400. All crafting skills at 400, with no additional bonuses will give you a 99%
chance to craft the item.

- **Weapon Crafting**: lets you craft all weapon based items. 
- **Armour Crafting**: lets you craft all armour based items.
- **Ring Crafting**: lets you craft all ring based items.
- **Spell Crafting**: lets you craft all spell based items.
- **Artifact Crafting**: lets you craft all artifact based item.

Gaining levels increases your skill bonus, which increases the odds of the item being created.

> All crafting comes with a 10-second timeout. You may attack and move, set sail, embark on an adventure, manage your kingdom, attack another kingdom, and/or teleport while the timer runs.

## Pay attention to chat

Chat will inform you of success/failure and gold deficiency when it comes to crafting.

## Limited Items

You can only craft items of the type selected, at any time, by clicking Craft/Enchant dropdown (see image above), can you remove the crafting section or change the type.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> These dropdown actions are disabled when the timer for the crafting/enchanting is running.

As you level your crafting skill, more items will be unlocked for that type.

## The Cost of crafting

The cost to craft an item is based on the items base cost (You can visit the shop to see their base cost, or see the table below). If the character doesn't have the gold, you won't be able to craft the item.

Think of the cost as the "materials needed" cost.

## Crafted items are useless without enchanting them

The whole point of crafting items is to then enchant them. Sure you can craft yourself a new suit of armour and a new weapon, but you can't then sell that on the market board. There's money to be made in enchanting gear.

Enchantments are what make gear unique, you can enchant gear to your specific needs. More on that in [Enchanting](/information/enchanting)

> ### ATTN!
>
> You cannot sell regular items, even those that you craft, on the [market]() board. Only items with enchantments applied to them may be sold via the market board. Non enchanted items can be sold to the shopkeeper for their appropriate price.

# List of Craftable Items

All items in the table can be clicked on by their name. We use color coding to determine item "rarity" for example:
