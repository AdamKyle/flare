## Regarding Trinkets

Players must have access to Purgatory to farm [Copper Coins](/information/currencies) which are used in crafting trinkets. This is tied to a skill called: Trinketry, which can be leveled by using 
Gold dust and Copper coins.

Trinkets add Ambush Chance and Resistance and Counter Chance and Resistance.

This is the only item, aside from [Alchemy items](/information/usable-items) that requires you to craft them. These are more late game items that help you with fighting creatures in 
purgatory.

Players can have two equipped and can sell these to the shop, but not buy them from the shop at 100x LESS than the cost of gold dust plus taxes.

When selling these on the market they are sold for 100x MORE than the gold dust cost.

These items cannot have [Enchantments](/information/enchanting) and cannot have [Holy Oils](/information/holy-items) applied.

You can read more about how ambush and counter works in the [combat section](/information/combat).

## Regarding Crafting Trinkets

There are no enchantments or artifacts that will increase your [Trinketry](/information/skill-information) skill. Instead, you will need to unlock Alchemy through a [quest](/information/quests) to then level it up and
craft special alchemical items that give you crafting boons for specific amounts of time.

In other words, it will take time, currency and effort to master Trinketry as, it is advised, players should have Alchemy at level 60 before attempting to craft trinkets 
(There is a level 60 alchemy item that gives you 50% bonus to skill XP and Skill bonus that stacks and last 40 minutes.) See [Usable Items](/information/usable-items) for more info.

# List of Quest Items

The following quest items help to increase the amount of XP gained for crafting an item. Each crafting skill only gives you 0.25% bonus per level, taking 400 levels give you 99% bonus towards crafting.

These books can give you a +150% XP bonus.

Some of these are easy to get such as simply visiting specific locations and the item drops, completing specific adventures or fighting specific monsters hoping it drops.

and any other rewards you get for just visiting the location. Clicking on adventures to view their details

> to see if they have the drop in question.
