## Regarding Trinkets

Players must have access to Purgatory to farm [Copper Coins](/information/currencies) which are used in crafting trinkets. This is tied to a skill called: Trinketry, which can be leveled by using 
Gold dust and Copper coins.

Trinkets add Ambush Chance and Resistance and Counter Chance and Resistance.

Ambush will give you up to 75% chance to completely bypass the enemies chance to dodge or block, while resistance will help you fight off the enemies ambush attempt.

Ambush will also do up to 2x the weapon damage or spell damage (for cast and attack and attack and cast, this will do 1.75X for each)

Counter will allow you to counter with your weapon attack at +50% after the enemy has attack with their weapon, only if you have not been killed in the process.

These are late game items that are crucial for being able to take on stronger purgatory creatures.

## Regarding Crafting Trinkets

There are no enchantments or artifacts that will increase your [Trinketry](/information/skill-information) skill. Instead, you will need to unlock Alchemy through a [quest](/information/quests) to then level it up and
craft special alchemical items that give you crafting boons for specific amounts of time.

In other words, it will take time, currency and effort to master Trinketry as, it is advised, players should have Alchemy at level 60 before attempting to craft trinkets 
(There is a level 60 alchemy item that gives you 50% bonus to skill XP and Skill bonus that stacks and last 40 minutes.) See [Usable Items](/information/usable-items) for more info.

# List of Quest Items

The following quest items help to increase the amount of XP gained for crafting an item. Each crafting skill only gives you 0.25% bonus per level, taking 400 levels give you 99% bonus towards crafting.

These books can give you a +150% XP bonus.

Some of these are easy to get such as simply visiting specific locations and the item drops, completing specific adventures or fighting specific monsters hoping it drops.
