## Why Should I craft, If I can just buy it in the shop?

This is a common question around crafting that I get sometimes. The core reason to craft, is so that you can level the 
appropriate crafting skill to then be able to craft gear that isn't in the shop.

Core crafting will take you to roughly ~220. That is, crafting all the items in the shop. After that, are items you cannot buy from
the shop, but can craft. These are more expensive and have better stats than shop based gear.

Tlessa aims to introduce new gear sets ever minor and major patch to introduce new gear, affixes and other such items.

Gear is also useless without affixes. A capped character, at the time of this writing, with the most expensive gear- 
with no affixes - cannot fight the final surface mob.

You craft to then enchant the gear, as stated previously.

Below you can see all the "craft only" gear that you cannot buy from the shop.
