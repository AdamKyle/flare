In Tlessa there are two types of enchantments: Craftable and Random. The latter is not craftable but can be sold and purchased
from the market board.

With Randomly Generated Enchantments, these are a few names to watch for:

- Petrifying Hatred of Disease
- Almighty Rage of the Dead
- Sanctifying Earth Tendrils
- Serenity of Life
- Rebirth of the Ancients
- Enchantment of Apathy
- Decay and Festering
- Scream of Sanctification
- Invincibility Rod
- Spiritbound Rage
- Exile\'s Enchantment
- Demonic Infinity
- Guardians Fear

These can appear as Prefixes, Suffixes **OR BOTH**. The stats, everything about them is randomly generated.

For example, lets look at the cost to percentage range:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Gold Cost</th>
            <th>Hell Shard Cost</th>
            <th>Percentage Range</th>
            <th>Damage Range</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1 Billion</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>75% - 125%</td>
            <td>500k - 5 Million</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10 Billion</td>
            <td>25</td>
            <td>150% - 300%</td>
            <td>10 Million - 25 Million</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>50 Billion</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>325% - 750%</td>
            <td>10 Million - 25 Million</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- Cost in Gold and Hell shards is only applicable when purchasing, not re-rolling stats. Only the gold cost is used.
- Percentage Range refers to all percentage based aspects, such as stats, resistances and so on with some % based stats only taking 10% of the random generated percentage,
  ie, some aspects may only take 75% if you manage a perfect 750% for the percentage range.
- Damage Range - the range in damage, the stacking or irresistible aspect is random.

When doing [Factions](/infromation/factions) you can get any item (up to a total cost of 4 billion gold - that's beyond shop gear!) with one or two randomly generated
affixes on them. These will be green in your inventory.

**Players may only equip one of these at a time, and sets may also only contain one, or the set will not be equippable**.

A unique item, is any item that has one (or two) unique enchantments on it.

These are unique such that they do not, cannot - drop from anywhere, except two: **The Queen of Hearts in Hell** (See [npcs](/information/npcs)). You can pay the cost to have her create one of these.
which is paid in Gold and then re-roll them and move them to other items using Shards and Gold Dust.

When a player levels a Faction from 0-1, for example, they will get a randomly generated unique. There are a series of [quests](/information/quests) that you can do to access her
as a player. Not only do you need a quest item to get into Hell, where she is located, but you also need a quest item that allows you to talk to her.

## Queen of Hearts

The Queen of Hearts is inspired by a character off another game, called Disgea 5. There characters name is Seraphina, a bubbly character that might be able to have a crush on you.

Players, who are familiar with Disgea will recognize this, while others who are not, will see her as a fun NPC to interact with.

- **To Speak with her**: Players must finish the **Queens Decision** Quest
- **To Access her**: Players must finish the **Hells Gates** Quest
- **Players must have their uniques they want to re-roll or move in the inventory and not be equipped. She will not look in sets.**

Players must be at her location on Hell to interact with her. To complete these quests, take a moment and check out the [quests](/information/quests) documentation to understand
how players can complete quests and see quests as well as details how to complete, in game.

Now that we have completed the quest lets discuss the panel you see when you interact with her. There are two types of panels that can open:

This one, below, will show up if you have no uniques in your inventory:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/has-no-uniques.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/has-no-uniques.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

This one, below, will show up if you have uniques in your inventory you will see the following:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/purcahse.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/purchase.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

There are three tabs to use here: Purchase, Re Roll and Move

Let's go through the first tab, which is also what you will see if you have no uniques (see first image above)

Here we can see that we can select what's known as a Valuation. The valuation only applies to the way the unique is generated. As you see below, each valuation has
their own ranges for percentage based stats and damage range stats.

When you purchase a unique she can generate it on any item up to a total cost of 4 billion (regardless of valuation chosen) and she will generate 
an item with one or two affixes.

All stats are randomly generated.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/purcahsed.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/purchased.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

When she has created the item, you will see the above message. Let's look at the item that was generated.

The next few images will go over all aspects of the affix we just generated, Take your time and read through them. We are just showing you the affix 
break down. This item, as we see, generated with two affixes.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-base.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-base.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-stats.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-stats.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-skills.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-skills.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-damage.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-damage.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-resistance.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/item-resistance.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As we saw in the breakdown, we have some good rolls and some bad ones, If you look at the stats image, you can see the second affix generated with no stats and the first one generated with stats but none
for enemy stat reduction, which is vital as you get closer to End game (Purgatory - see [planes](/information/planes)).

Let's now take this Unique and reroll its stats, keeping in minds that every re-roll costs gold dust and shards and is completely rng.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/re-roll.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/re-roll.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Now, lets select our unique from the first dropdown, more will appear, then select "All attached enchantments" and finally select Stats.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/set-up-re-roll.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/set-up-re-roll.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You can see the cost in the image above.

The cost is based on:

- Base cost of 10K gold dust and 100 Shards
- Then we double that if you are doing both affixes.
- Then based on what you select for the third select, see below, we charge you a % on top of the cost.

In this case the cost is: 10K GD + 10K GD (both affixes) + 16.6666% for the selection of stats.

Now, when selecting what to re roll you have some options:

- Base
- Stats
- Skills
- Resistance
- Damage
- Everything

These all correspond to the tab of the affix, from the above images (of the generated affix break down).

**The name will never be rerolled, nor will the type be.**

In our case we are re-rolling the stats, hence the 16.6666%, but if we re rolled everything on these affixes the cost would be:

- 10K GD * 4 for Gold dust (40k)
- 100 Shards * 4 for Shard cost (400)

Lets re roll our stats, as we have them selected.

Do note, that since we are re-rolling our stats, all stats including enemy stat reductions will be re-rolled. You cannot pick and choose stats.

> # ATTN!!

> If you have the item, that you purchased or re-rolled open in a new tab, you cannot refresh that tab and see the new stats, instead you must go to your inventory, find the item and open it

> Remember, all items that you are holding or have equipped are just references to the items and affix combinations already in game.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/re-rolled.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/re-rolled.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see we re-rolled out item, if we look at it, and compare it to the item, we might have open in a separate tab, we can see
that the stats have changed. I won't show you here, as I just flooded you with images the first time, but your unique that you re rolled should have new stats
if you are following along (and have appropriate access, quest item - see above.)

You can keep doing this until you are out of gold dust or until you have the affix you want. Remember, this is all RNG, it could take a while.

Let's assume we have re-rolled the items the way we want them, as we can see we have two affixes on this item, now we want to move these 
affixes to another item, that we crafted.

So lets head over to the move tab:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/move-uniques.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/move-uniques.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see here it looks very similar to the re-roll tab we were just on. Lets select our item and another item we want to move the Affixes to.

> ##ATTN
> 
> The Queen will only re-roll and move Affixes that are considered unique. She can move them to an item that contains another affix, or overwrite affixes.
> When moving, even if you move only one affix over, and have another non-unique affix attached, that item is still considered a unique, thus you can only
> equip one and only have one in a set at a given time.

Let's set up our unique to be moved:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/set-up-movement.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/set-up-movement.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

In the above image we are saying we want to take the affixes from this item, move both of them to new item we selected.

You can move uniques to other items containing uniques, enchantments or no enchantments. 

**However both the item and the unique must be in your inventory and not equipped.**

The cost break down is:

> The cost break down is as such: Affix(es) cost (ie, 100 billion + 100 billion for a unique with two enchants at a valuation of 100 billion) 
> for the gold. while the shard cost is 0.000002% of the total gold cost, never falling below 10 shards. 
> This can mean a 100 billion unique with one enchant will cost ~2k in shards to move and 100 billion in gold.

*From the image above*

Once we move the item:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/moved-unique.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/moved-unique.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

We can see that she's a fun character, but we also see:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/please-the-queen.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/random-enchants/images/please-the-queen.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

A global message go out. There are a couple types:

- CharacterName Makes the Queen of Hearts glow so bright, thousands of demons in Hell are banished by her beauty and power alone! (triggers when you move both affixes)
- CharacterName Makes the Queen of Hearts laugh! She is falling in love! (triggers when you move some affixes)
- CharacterName Makes the Queen of Hearts blush! She is attracted to them now. (triggers when you move an affix over, but it does not delete the item from your inventory.)

Speaking of the last point, moving affixes can delete the item they were attached too. You cannot move affixes from one item to another and keep the "non-enchanted" Item.

As we can see the Queen of Hearts is more an end game NPC that you would access to help build one good unique for taking on Purgatory creatures. These are balanced around you
having at least one Affix and being closer to Max level to be able to take on some creatures down in Purgatory which can level a character faster than the speed of light.

## Regarding the Market Board

Uniques will not allow you to list them for less than half their cost. For example a single item with a single unique enchantment at a valuation of 10 Billion Gold cannot be sold
for less than 5 Billion gold.

This is to prevent High level players, from making toons (AKA: Additional character) and listing expensive, hard to get (and perfect) uniques for nothing.

## Regarding Disenchant and Destroy

Players may disenchant and destroy these uniques.
