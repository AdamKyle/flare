## Randomly Generated Enchantments

In Tlessa there are two types of enchantments: Craftable and Random. The latter is not craftable but can be sold and purchased
from the market board.

With Randomly Generated Enchantments, these are a few names to watch for:

- Petrifying Hatred of Disease
- Almighty Rage of the Dead
- Sanctifying Earth Tendrils
- Serenity of Life
- Rebirth of the Ancients
- Enchantment of Apathy
- Decay and Festering
- Scream of Sanctification
- Invincibility Rod
- Spiritbound Rage
- Exile\'s Enchantment
- Demonic Infinity
- Guardians Fear

These can appear as Prefixes, Suffixes **OR BOTH**. The stats, everything about them is randomly generated.

For example, lets look at the cost to percentage range:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Gold Cost</th>
            <th>Hell Shard Cost</th>
            <th>Percentage Range</th>
            <th>Damage Range</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1 Billion</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>75% - 125%</td>
            <td>500k - 5 Million</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10 Billion</td>
            <td>25</td>
            <td>150% - 300%</td>
            <td>10 Million - 25 Million</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>50 Billion</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>325% - 750%</td>
            <td>10 Million - 25 Million</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- Cost in Gold and Hell shards is only applicable when purchasing, not re-rolling stats. Only the gold cost is used.
- Percentage Range refers to all percentage based aspects, such as stats, resistances and so on with some % based stats only taking 10% of the random generated percentage,
  ie, some aspects may only take 75% if you manage a perfect 750% for the percentage range.
- Damage Range - the range in damage, the stacking or irresistible aspect is random.

When doing [Factions](/infromation/factions) you will get and item, could be any item in the whole game, with one or two of these affixes attached.

These are unique such that they do not, cannot - drop from anywhere, except one: The Queen of Hearts in Hell. You can pay the cost to have her create one of these.

She will also let you re-roll parts of the enchantment or the whole enchantment for the cost of the enchantment (ie, 1, 10 or 50 billion) and only requires the shards to make
the item. She will attach the affix she creates to any item of your choosing provided you have the item in your inventory (and not in a set/equipped).

These types of enchantments, because of their nature are so unique and so hard to get, let alone modify to squeeze every last ounce of power out of them,
that while yes you will get one for probably doing the surface kills to 500 - they won't feel powerful till you level more, as with anything in Tlessa,
the power of items and enchants comes from you leveling your character.

No two Affix will ever be the same, and if you manage to get one, that someone else has - count your self lucky. These can go for billions, if not trillions of gold.

You cannot craft these, but you can, if you have the gold, buy them from the market board.

You can tell if you have of these item's because they show up green in the inventory and everywhere else that shows the item name's color.
