## How To Train a Passive

It's actually quite simple, just click Train on an unlocked passive:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdom-passive-skills/images/training-screen.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdom-passive-skills/images/training-screen.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see from the above image, we are told what we get when we level the skill up.

The one thing you should take into consideration is: Do I want to spend the hours for this skill, or do I want to go another way?

Why? because if you cancel a skill that takes 10 hours and its at the 9-hour mark, you have to do those 9 hours again. We do not take into consideration
any previous time when starting the training of the skill again.

When this is done, you'll see a notification in the notification center:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdom-passive-skills/images/notifications.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdom-passive-skills/images/notifications.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

There is no email sent out to those not logged in.

As you can see I have quite a few of these.

That's all there is to it. The effects of the passives are already applied to your kingdom when the skill reaches a new level.
