# Usable items and Alchemy

With the new skill called Alchemy - which can only be unlocked after completing a quest, players can craft new items 
that cannot be sold to the shop, destroyed or disenchanted and do not drop.

These items can be sold on the market board for any amount of gold you see fit.

Usable items require two things to craft: Gold Dust and Shards, which you can read about in [currencies](/information/currencies).

Using these you can begin to level the Skill: Alchemy by crafting these items.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> There are not enough items for the average player to level from level 1-400. More items will be added over time.

Right now there are two types of usable items: Boons and Kingdom Damaging Items.

## Boons

Character boons are bonuses applied to the character for a limited amount of time. Character may have up to ten boons applied at
any time. If a character uses ten items that effect, for example: stats - then all those bonuses will stack.

When a player uses a boon, if they play with the game tab in another screen - the effects of the items will be applied automatically.

## Kingdom Damaging

Checkout [Items and Kingdoms](/information/items-and-kingdoms) for more information.

There are items that you can craft that when dropped on a kingdom will do damage to that kingdom. They can do a percentage of damage that stack
with the more items you use. This will alert the defending player that their kingdom is under attack.

Below is a list of items that you can currently craft in the game.
