# Celestials

Celestials in Tlessa are competitive enemies that are stronger than critters in the drop-down list and can be fought by anyone
including groups of players.

However, the character that kills the Celestial entity gets the reward. Hence, the competitive part.

These Creatures can give out Gold Dust, Shards, Items and even have a chance to drop quest items used in [quests](/information/quests).

Celestialâ€™s can be conjured to their respective plane either publicly or privately by speaking with the correct [NPC](/information/npcs).

If conjured publicly, a global message will go out with coordinates to the location of the entity, allowing any
character, to swoop in and kill it.

If conjured privately, you will get the coordinates, that you may share, or not.

Celestial entities can randomly appear with a one-in-a-million chance of spawning by the player, 
any player, moving (directional buttons), teleportation or setting sail. 

When a Celestial Entity is conjured or spawns, there is a chance for the creature, if it lands on a kingdom, to do damage to the kingdom.
This is a one-in-a-billion chance to do damage.

Below are is a table of all the Celestial Entities:
