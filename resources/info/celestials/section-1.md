# Celestials

Celestials in Planes of Tlessa are difficult creatures that players can come together and help each other fight.

These Creatures can give out Gold Dust, Shards, Items and even have a chance to drop quest items used in quests.

Celestial’s can be conjured to any plane either publicly or privately by speaking with the correct NPC on the plane you wish to summon the entity.

If conjured publicly, a global message will go out with coordinates to the location of the entity. If conjured privately, you will get the coordinates, that you may share, or not.

Celestial entities can randomly appear with a one-in-a-million chance of spawning by the player, any player, moving (directional buttons), teleportation or setting sail. When a Celestial entity spawns this way, it can spawn on any plane and a global message will go out alerting all players of a new celestial.

## How to Conjure

To publicly or privately conjure a Celestial, you will need both Gold and Gold Dust. Next you can message the appropriate NPC:

Based on whom you message, you will get an image as such:

From here you can select the creature you want to conjure.

Here you can see a celestial was conjured privately.


## Killing a Celestial

To fight a celestial, you first have to go to its location. They can spawn anywhere on the plane they were paid to be on, or on any plane if they are a random public spawn.

Because of the random nature to their spawn, there is a chance of them spawning in water based locations that require a special quest item to access.

Once at the location, a player will see a new “Attack Celestial” button in the actions section:

Clicking it lets them join:

Once in the battle, the player may notice the enemies' health moving down in real time. That's because Celestial Fights can be done by multiple players. Instead of fighting a creature client side and sending the important data to the server. The fight happens on the server – timing each participant out for 10 seconds in between attacks.

This allows other players an opportunity to try to do damage to the entity.

Should you fall in the fight, you’ll be greeted by the typical revive time out and button before being able to revive and attack again.

If you are facing the beast alone, you can die and revive as many times as you need to whittle it down and all health information about the Celestial is kept on the server as opposed to the client.

As you fight the creature (and it’s public) you might notice that its health drops before you even attack it, but you won't see any information about why – this is because another player has probably attacked the creature.

## Being first to kill the entity

You have to be first to kill the entity. Regardless of if it is public, private what ever the case may be – you have to be the one that kills the entity to get any reward.

If you don’t, there is no reward for “damage done”.

## Quests

Come celestials might drop quest items, these can then be turned into the quest giver to get the appropriate rewards.
