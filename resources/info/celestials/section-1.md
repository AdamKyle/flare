# Celestials

> ### ATTN!!
> 
> Players who have over 1 trillion health will have their health capped at 1 trillion when joining the fight.
> This is due to the fact that classes such as Vampires can get their health in to the quadrillions and the database cannot handle a number
> that large.
> 
> Your attacks will still be based off the modded dur (for vampires) which will still be higher than 1 trillion. The damage does not change, the health you
> you have when entering the fight does.
> 
> Other classes will have nothing to worry about, even if their health gets capped as well for the fight.

Celestials in Tlessa are competitive enemies that are stronger than critters in the drop-down list and can be fought by anyone
including groups of players.

However, the character that kills the Celestial entity gets the reward. Hence, the competitive part.

These Creatures can give out Gold Dust, Shards, Items and even have a chance to drop quest items used in [quests](/information/quests).

Celestials can be conjured to their respective plane either publicly or privately by speaking with the correct [NPC](/information/npcs).

If conjured publicly, a global message will go out with coordinates to the location of the entity, allowing any
character, to swoop in and kill it.

If conjured privately, you will get the coordinates, that you may share, or not.

Celestial entities can randomly appear with a one-in-a-million chance of spawning by the player, 
any player, moving (directional buttons), teleportation or setting sail. 

When a Celestial Entity is conjured or spawns, there is a chance for the creature, if it lands on a kingdom, to do damage to the kingdom.
This is a one-in-a-billion chance to do damage.
