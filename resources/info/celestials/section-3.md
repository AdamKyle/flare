## How to conjure and fight

As mentioned before to conjure a Celestial entity, you have to be on the plane of the one you want, and you
have to be at the location of the NPC who is a conjurer.

You will also need the Gold Dust and the Gold to cover the cost.

From here we can message the NPc in question:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/must-be-at-location.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/must-be-at-location.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see we have to be at their location. Teleport or move to their location and from there message them again.

This time you should see:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/conjuration-options.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/conjuration-options.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Now we can select our Entity to conjure. Once we have - we can choose public or private.

If it's public every one will be told of the location of the entity. If it's private, as we will do in this example, you will
see that the location details are only given to you. Before we see those details we have to pay:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/cost-to-conjure.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/cost-to-conjure.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Once we pay, assuming we have the gold dust and gold, we will see:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/payment.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/payment.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

This tells us the location and confirms we have paid the NPC. Let's head over to that location to fight our entity.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> These entities can spawn anywhere on the map, including on water or (for dungeons) Death Water.
> Make sure you have the appropriate quest item to be able to walk on those surfaces. If you do not have them
> and the entity spawns on the surface you cannot walk on, the conjuration is wasted.
> 
> Celestial entities also despawn, both publicly and privately an hour after it's been conjured.
> 
> Players may only conjure one at a time for private - although there can be multiple private summons from multiple players.
> 
> If a public Celestial is present a player cannot conjure another public entity.

Ok, so we made it to the location of the entity, from above, and our actions have been updated:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/new-options.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/new-options.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

If we click this we now see:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/celestial-fight.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/celestial-fight.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Any player, if they have the coordinates, can join. All they have to do is come to this same location and click the same button and
see the same as you.

As you attack, you will get data showing you: your attack. Then you will be timed out for 10 seconds to allow other players who might be in the area
a chance. However, the better gear you have - the better the odds you can kill the Celestial in one hit. If you do, chat will update to show you:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/celestials/images/reward.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/celestials/images/reward.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

That's all there is to Celestial fights. Some drops quest items required by specific NPCs.
