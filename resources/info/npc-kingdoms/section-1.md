# NPC Kingdoms

Havenâ€™t been online in 5 days? On the 6th day you will lose morale on the 
hourly reset which would normally, give you treasury, population and resources. 
Instead, every hour your kingdom will lose morale until it 0%. At which time the kingdom 
will take by an NPC, and a global message will go out:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/kingdom-given-to-npc.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/kingdom-given-to-npc.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Players will see there maps update automatically to reflect that there is a new yellow kingdom: NPC Kingdoms

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/npc-kingdom.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/npc-kingdom.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Players can visit these kingdoms and message the kingdom holder npc while standing on a yellow 
kingdom to take the kingdom.

> Characters will need to have the gold, if they have more than one kingdom and be standing ON the kingdom they wish
> to take.

Upon taking the kingdom, the character will see a message, and a global message will go out:

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/took-npc-kingdom.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/took-npc-kingdom.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

The map will also update to show that a player has taken that kingdom.

<div class="mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/took-kingdom.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/npc-kingdoms/images/took-kingdom.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

## NPC Kingdoms Can Crumble

Should an NPC kingdom not be taken in 5 days of it being handed over, the kingdom will crumble, freeing space up
for new players to settle.
