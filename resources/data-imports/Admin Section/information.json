If you are not a heretic or other class where int is your primary damage (this means it gets 2 points per level) and are less then level 500, you will need to craft gear that raises your int, so you can enchant higher level and int required items.<\/p><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> There is not enchantments for Alchemy or Quick Feet Skill.
