# Planes of Tlessa 1.5.2

Welcome back ladies and gents to another release: 1.5.2

## Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue with Guide Quests where a quest item required could be upgraded or traded in to a complete quest, thus we need to check if you took the item you need and upgraded it. If so, it still counts because you once had it.
- Fixed Accuracy and Dodge Enchantments
