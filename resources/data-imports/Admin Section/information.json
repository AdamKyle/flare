# Planes of Tlessa 1.5.1

Welcome back ladies and gents to another release: 1.5.1

## Bug Fixes:

- Fixed "Enchanting is key" Guide quest to allow players to complete it once they have reached the required level for Skill Type: Crafting.
- Fixed an issue with kingdom units on mobile showing NAN for the seconds when trying to recruit them.
	+ Updated the Time Help modal to properly shows days, hours, minutes and then seconds with a bit of help text.
- Fixed issue with Enchanting:
	+ We never had Spell Crafting Enchants. So those were generated.
	+ Selecting Ring Crafting would show nothing, but Spell Crafting would show Ring Enchants, this has been fixed.
