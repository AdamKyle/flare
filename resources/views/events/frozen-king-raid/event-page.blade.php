                    Simply log in and head down to the Ice Plane and search for a skull location. One of these locations will have the raid boss as the first critter in the list. The rest will be Raid Critters.

                <dt>What level should I be?</dt>
                <dd>
                    If you want to take on raid critters I would suggest you reincarnate your character at least once and have a full set of Purgatory chain gear. But if you are loking at fighting the raid boss, any level will do!
