<x-core.modals.modal id="guide-explanation" title="What is The Guide">
    <p class="mb-4">
        The Guide is a NPC who will, as his name implies, Guide you through the game.
        He starts off basic with killing creatures, and by the end of his quest line you will have a firm grasp
        on the fundamentals of the game.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">After registration you will see the first guide quest modal popup in game with your first quest.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        During the course of the quest line, you will embark on a story of sorts as each Guide Quest is broken in three parts:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
        <li>Requirements</li>
        <li>Story</li>
        <li>Instructions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
        There are instructions for both Mobile and Desktop as the UI for each is slightly different,
        all the mechanics are the same - just how you access specific things are different.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        You can access The Guide any time by clicking the green button in the top bar after closing the guide modal.
        Each quests teaches you a bit about the game, the lore and rewards you with gear and gold.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        If you choose not to enable this, you can do so from the User settings page in game while your character is below level 10.
        Guide quests will guide you through till level 1000 (there are 4000+ levels).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-red-500 font-bold italic">
        Once enabled, Guide Quests cannot be shut off. The Modal that initiates the quests is not designed to be annoying (it won't always pop up, after the first time, it's up to you to open and initiate the next quest). Players will have access to their guide quests
        under their quest log to refer to "simple" how to's. For detailed explanations, players can always refer to the <a href="/information/home">Help Docs</a>. Throughout the game there are various links
        that reference the help docs for detailed info. The Guide does not go into in-depth explanation of mechanics, just the "how to access, what it does and how to complete the quest". We give you enough to complete the job, it's up to you to
        reference the comprehensive help docs for more info or ask in chat or discord.
