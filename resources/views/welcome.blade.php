                        Deepest apologizes, however Planes of Tlessa is currently down for maintenance and unlike other deployments,
                        this one has had to disable the Registration and Login for a short time. We promise to be back up and running soon
                        and hope to see you all in-game soon. For more info, please check <a href="https://discord.gg/hcwdqJUerh" target="_blank">Discord.</a>

                            No, and there never will be. You cannot buy anything in this game, no weapons, gear, armor,
                            advantages, nothing. You want it, you will earn it.

                        <dt>Is it persistent?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Yes. You can log out if you are in the middle of an adventure or are launching an attack
                            on another kingdom. Assuming you have the right settings enabled, you will be
                            emailed when the action is finished.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Is it idle?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            No and yes. The majority of the game is not idle based, but aspects such as managing
                            your kingdom, or going on adventures are considered idle. Adventures can range from 10-60 minutes
                            in length and disable you from doing pretty much anything. You can log out and be emailed, when it's done.
                            Kingdoms are also idle based in the fact that it takes time to recruit, build and attack.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Does it use energy systems?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            No. Tlessa uses what's called: <a href="/information/time-gates">Time Gates</a>. These apply to actions you do and time you out
                            from doing that action again for a matter of seconds or minutes. However, the goal of Tlessa is
                            not to keep you engaged, so for example you could: Fight, Craft, Move and then wait for their respective timers
                            to end before doing the same thing. In the aforementioned example: Killing a monster gates you a 10 second time
                            out before being able to kill the monster again, but being killed by said monster, gives you a 20 second timeout before being able
                            to revive.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Are there factions/guilds/clans?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            No. In Tlessa, it's every person for themselves. There is no guild or clan system in Tlessa.
