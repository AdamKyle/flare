<p class="mt-2">
  Focus on Charisma to attack, but do not neglect Focus when it comes to your class special.
</p>
<p>It is suggested you equip A censer and A dagger. this will allow your Plague Surge to fire off more reliably, based on your class bonus %.</p>
<p>
This class is designed as a healing based class, however to get your special to fire, which will deal 22% of your modded Focus,
  to the enemy and heal you for the damage you did, you will often find your self using attack. It's about knowing when to balance the two.
