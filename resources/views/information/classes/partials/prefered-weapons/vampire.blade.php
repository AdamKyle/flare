        Vampires only care about raising their durability to do moore damage, and shields do just that. However, you should also invest in <a href="/information/enchanting" target="_blank"> Life stealing enchantments <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
        as you will be able to steal up to 99% of the enemies health in soe instances.

        Vampires do best with
        <a href="/information/combat" target="_blank"> Defend <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> when it comes to combat to fire off their special attack
        or <a href="/information/combat" target="_blank"> Attack <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> when using life stealing enchantments to kill their enemy.
