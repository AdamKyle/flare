        Apothecary's balance the ability of dealing damage with the ability to heal.
        They balance their Charisma with their Focus, they unleash a plague upon the weak and siphon the health of the strong.

        Apothecary's are best with
        <a href="/information/combat" target="_blank"> Attack <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> when it comes to combat to fire off their special attack
        or <a href="/information/combat" target="_blank"> Heal <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> when trying to survive a little bit longer.
