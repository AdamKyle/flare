<p class="mt-2">Focus on Durability followed by Accuracy and Criticality.</p>
<p>It is suggested you equip claws or two shields.</p>

  Load yourself up with
  <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affixes</a>
  and
  <a href="/information/enchanting">durability affixes</a>
  , along with a
  <a href="/information/enchanting">Damage based affix</a>
</p>
<p>
  There are two attack types you could do. One that involves purely attacking or
  one that involves purely casting. For vampires it is recommended you go with
  attacking. The reason for this, is because your life stealing affixes will not
  do enough damage to kill the enemy and, if the damage you do via attacking is
  strong enough your life stealing affixes will not fire.
</p>
<p>
  The issue with cast, is you do not do enough damage as a pure "caster vamp".
</p>
<p>
  Vampire's life stealing affixes will scale with enemy health. The idea is that
  you want to fight the hardest thing you can kill in one hit that triggers your
  enchantments to fire. You keep killing that creature until your enchantments
  no longer fire, and then move on. This allows vampires to take on creatures
  that are a bit tougher than them.
