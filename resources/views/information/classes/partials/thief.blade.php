  Focus on raising your Agility and Dexterity. Train your Accuracy skill to make sure you can hit something, then your class skill.
</p>
<p>Thieves will want to dual wield if they want their class skill to fire before they attack to see if they can "dance through the shadows" and auto hit.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on dexterity and agility based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Thieves should use attack as they are dual wielding over anything else.
</p>
<p>Thieves will want a race that is quick and nimble (High Elf or Centaur) or focuses on dexterity (Orc).</p>
<h3>Regarding PVP</h3>
<p>Thieves are the only class who have a different special attack for PVP. Because of how your current special works, you can evade the enemies attempt to block
and just go for the jugular - Shadow Dance.</p>
<p>To give other players a fighting chance, your special has been changed during PVP to be back-stab attack. The same rules apply, duel wielding and class bonus give you a chance
to fire this off. You will do 2x your modded dexterity as the special attack.</p>
