<h4>Hints</h4>
<p class="mt-2">
  Focus on your Charisma and Focus stat while leveling Casting Accuracy followed by your class skill.
</p>
<p>Prophets will want either two damage spells, two healing or one of either. If you have two damaging spells we add 15% of your chr to your total attack.
Your healing will still fire as 30% of your chr stat. If you have no damaging spells, you'll cast for 2% of your chr and heal for your healing + 30% of your chr.</p>
<p>
  There is an exception to this. If a prophet has no damage spell equipped, Cast and Attack and Attack and Cast will not fire off any damage spells.
  That is because you do not have them physically equipped. Prophets are not adept at magic like Heretics are.
</p>
<p>Prophets will always want one healing spell if they plan to get off their double heal special attack.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on chr and focus based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Prophets do not need weapons, so if you go glass cannon, then equip two damage spells and two shields. If you are going for a safer play,
  equip a damage spell and a healing spell and two shields with additional durability enchants on them. Low level characters should play it safe to start, until they can
  get their Casting Accuracy up.
</p>
<p>Prophets will want either Dryad or High Elf a their race.</p>
<p>
  For Casters, start with training your <a href="/information/skills">Casting Accuracy skill</a> at 10% of your xp around level 3 or so.
</p>
<p>
  Casters and Vampires are the hardest class to play from the start because their attacks are tied to their stats more closely then other classes. This can make early
  game a bit of a grind to get going, but once you do it will pay off in the long run as Heretics and Vampires are some of the end games strongest classes.
  For your cast to work properly, unless its a heal spell, you need a Casting Accuracy of at least level 5 to hit more then miss.
