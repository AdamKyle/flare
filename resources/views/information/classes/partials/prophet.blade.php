  Focus on your Charisma and Focus stat while leveling Casting Accuracy followed by your class skill.
</p>
<p>Prophets will want either two damage spells, two healing or one of either. If you have two damaging spells, we add 15% of your chr to your total attack.
If you have no healing spells equipped you will still do 30% healing of your chr stat.</p>

<p>Prophets will always want one healing spell if they plan to get off their double heal special attack.</p>
<p>Prophets who also wield a weapon and a shield will get an extra 15% of their modded CHR towards their attack.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on chr and focus based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Prophets should focus on a good weapon, shield and healing spell and play either Cast and Attack or Attack and Cast
  depending on which slot their healing spell and weapon is in.
</p>
<p>
    For optimal play at the beginning of your journey, use <a href="/information/combat">Attack and Cast</a>. and focus on <a href="/information/skill-information">Accuracy</a>
    as your healing spells will never miss. Your healing spells also have a chance at auto resurrecting you, the better the healing spell,
    the better the chance, two combined will stack the chance.
</p>

<p>Prophets will want either Dryad or High Elf as their race, to get the most of their class.</p>

<p>You will also want to check out how <a href="/information/how-healing-works">healing works</a> within Tlessa. In a nut shell, healing spells only heal you, Prophets can become almost useless when all you do is heal your self. As a result, if you do not need to be healed,
when you attack, we create a "reserve" to then be used - automatically - when the enemy attacks, making the combination of healing and damage spells beneficial. Gain a little life, take a little life.</p>
