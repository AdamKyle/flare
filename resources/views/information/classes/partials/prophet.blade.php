<h4>Hints</h4>
<p class="mt-2">
  Focus on your Charisma and Focus stat while leveling Casting Accuracy followed by your class skill.
</p>
<p>Prophets will want either two damage spells, two healing or one of either. If you have two damaging spells we add 15% of your chr to your total attack.
Your healing will still fire as 30% of your chr stat. If you have no damaging spells, you'll cast for 2% of your chr and heal for your healing + 30% of your chr.</p>
<p>Prophets will always want one healing spell if they plan to get off their double heal special attack.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on chr and focus based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Prophets do not need weapons, so if you go glass cannon, then equip two damage spells and two shields. If you are going for a safer play,
  equip a damage spell and a healing spell and two shields with additional durability enchants on them.
</p>
<p>Prophets will want either Dryad or High Elf a their race.</p>
