<p class="mb-4">
    Prisoner is a cross between a Fighter and a Thief in the more early levels of their career.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Prisoner's do not have enchantments, much like the base classes, instead any gear that raises the class bonus
    for their special attack will do just fine.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Prisoner's are best using weapons (single-handed weapons, not staves, bows or hammers). While you have one or two
    weapons equipped you have a chance, based on your class bonus, to fire off your rage attack (detailed above).
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Prisoner's <a href="/information/class-ranks">class specials</a> focus mostly on reducing enemy stats and
    resistances as well as increasing your spell evasion.
