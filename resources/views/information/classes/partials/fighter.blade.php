  Fighters core stats are Strength for Damage and Dexterity to hit anything. Fighters should equip one weapon and one shield or two weapons
  and use the attack button. (See <a href="/information/combat">Combat</a> docs).
</p>
<p>It is not suggested you equip a bow as your class skill will give you no bonus.</p>
<p>Equipping a bow also will prevent your class skill from having a chance to fire the special double attack.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on Strength and Dexterity based. Later you will want at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Fighters have a variety of attacks they can utilize, for example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attack will use the full force of your attack.</li>
  <li>Cast and Attack or Attack and Cast can be used if you have a healing spell.</li>
  <li>Cast is useless to you because you won't have the intelligence. Technically you could go this route if you wanted to balance
    Your strength, Dexterity and Intelligence/Focus plus Casting Accuracy skill to become a "Battle Mage". But now you are stretching yourself too far.</li>
  <li>
    Defend is only useful if the enemy is about to kill you and you have some health left over as Fighters can have the greatest AC when it comes to defending.
    because you use your class bonus as a bonus towards your AC.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When attacking with no weapons, Fighters will do 5% of their strength as their attack, while other classes do 2%. When attacking with weapons you use 15% of your strength
  towards the overall damage.
</p>
<p>If you go the weapon/shield route, make sure to add some extra dur (through enchanting) to that shield and level your class skill for the extra armour class bonus.</p>
<p>Fighters will want a race that provides good strength and dex: Orc (dex and str - great for dual wielding), Dark Dwarf/Centaur (str and dur - great for weapon/shield).</p>
<p>For skills, it is best for you to focus on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy until you can reliably hit something with your weapon, being blocked is fine, you just need a better weapon.</li>
  <li>Soldiers Strength until roughly level 75 - Increases core damage and armour class</li>
  <li>Criticality until roughly 75-125 - you can do this first instead of Soldiers Strength if you would like</li>
  <li>Fighters Resilience until roughly 125 - This will let you attack more times per minute as your attack timer reduces in length.</li>
  <li>Looting till level 200 or so (can be done after Accuracy for more drops)</li>
  <li>Dodge till level 100 or so. Helps with dodging the attack.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Do not try and max any of these skills, they will take you a very long time. Instead focus on these and bounce around between skills.
    You can read more about <a href="/information/skill-information">skills</a> in the help docs. You will max them over time.
