    Clerics are one step up from the prophets of The Church. The Church, who believes in the one true God, was once responsible for training
    a military force of holy warriors who helped The Federation subjugate the land and it's people under its control.

    Clerics love to use a Mace and a Shield. If they have a healing spell equipped, it's best to use Attack and Cast to get the healing bonus
    of +45% of your CHR when healing.
</p>
<p>
    Dexterity is how you hit while Charisma is how you deal damage. Clerics like (<a href='/information/combat'>Attack</a> or Attack and Cast (with Healing Spell Equipped) when it comes to damage).
</p>
<p>
    Clerics have a special called: <strong>Holy Smite</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    With a Mace and Shield Equipped they will deal their CHR + 60% in damage.
</p>
<p>
    Your special can proc if you have leveled your <a href='/information/class-skils'>Class Skill</a> and have a high enough skill bonus.
</p>

<p>You will also want to check out how <a href="/information/how-healing-works">healing works</a> within Tlessa. In a nut shell, healing spells only heal you, Clerics can become almost useless when all you do is heal your self. As a result, if you do not need to be healed,
    when you attack, we create a "reserve" to then be used - automatically - when the enemy attacks, making the combination of healing and damage spells beneficial. Gain a little life, take a little life.</p>
