<h4>Hints</h4>
<p class="mt-2">
  Focus on raising your Agility and Dexterity. Train your Accuracy skill to make sure you can hit something, then your class skill.
</p>
<p>It is suggested you only equip a bow as your class skill has a chance to fire the damaging aspect and do triple attacks.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on dexterity and agility based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Rangers can use either attack, attack and cast or cast and attack, they can get away with out having a healing spell equipped so the cast based attacks will be good for them, but not pure cast
  as you want to attack with your bow. Defend is useless as you wont equip a shield.
</p>
<p>Rangers will want a race that quick and nimble (High Elf or Centaur) or focuses on dexterity, Orc.</p>
<p>When a Ranger heals they get an additional 15% of their chr stat towards their healing added to their spell's total healing or just 15% of their chr.</p>
