<h4>Hints</h4>
<p class="mt-2">
  Focus on your Intelligence and Focus stat while leveling Casting Accuracy followed by your class skill.
</p>
<p>Heretics will want two shields, added dur, and two damage spells. This will allow their class skill to fire off the double cast chance./p>
<p>Heretics also get 30% of their intelligence added to their spell damage.</p>
<p>
  For affixes, focus first on int and focus based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life stealing affix</a> and at least
  one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>Heretics can cast with out spells at 2% of their intelligence mod.</p>
<p>Heretics are glass cannon and should only focus on cast with no healing spells. They do not get any healing bonuses either.</p>
<p>Prophets will want either Dryad or High Elf a their race.</p>
