    Focus on your Intelligence and Focus stat while leveling Casting Accuracy followed by your class skill.

<p>Heretics will want two shields, for added dur, and two damage spells. This will allow their class skill to fire off
    the double cast chance.</p>

        When you first start out, for added attack, you could go stave, two spells and a body piece. This allows you to

        and focus on Accuracy, so you can actually hit harder creatures, before switching to Casting Accuracy. You can

<p>Heretics also get 30% of their intelligence added to their spell damage or 15% if they have no damage spells
    equipped.</p>
<p>
    For affixes, focus first on int and focus based, while having at least one <a href="/information/enchanting">life
        stealing affix</a> and at least
    one <a href="/information/enchanting">damaging affix</a>.
</p>
<p>Heretics are glass cannon and should only focus on Cast attack with no healing spells (at later stages). They do not
    get any healing bonuses from healing spells.</p>
<p>Heretics will want either Dryad or High Elf as their race.</p>
