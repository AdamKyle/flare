# Planes of Tlessa

Welcome to Planes of Tlessa!

Planes of Tlessa, codenamed Flare, is a [PBBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_game#Persistence) where players can level their characters, find loot, settle kingdoms, and much more.

Planes of Tlessa, also known as Tlessa, is completely free, with no pay-to-win mechanics and no restrictions on how long you can play.

All players are on the same level, working towards the same endgame, and acquiring the same gear. The only currency the game accepts is time.

## No Cash Shop

Tlessa does not make money from players at this time and has no intention of creating any kind of "paywall" for progression.

Every feature, every system, every aspect of the game that you interact with which progresses your character will always be 100% free.

Tlessa may, one day, offer cosmetic items in the shop, such as chat colors, titles, adventures in which you play through a text-based story, and are rewarded with a cosmetic item.

## No Energy Systems

There is no energy system in Tlessa. Play as long as you want or as little as you want. Tlessa does have timers that can range from seconds for crafting, fighting, and so on, to hours for special skills, building upgrades, and so on.

## Quests Unlock Features

Since the entire game is completely free, a lot of content is gated behind quests. There are tons of quests including raid quests when raids spawn. Quests unlock new planes, abilities, classes, skills, and other features of the game that allow your character to progress.

For example, new players have a max level cap of 1000. However, players who complete a series of quests (laid out as a tree) will unlock a quest item to allow them to level to 5000.
