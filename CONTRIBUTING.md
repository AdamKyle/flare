# How to contribute

When contributing to Flare you must take care of the following:

- No PR will be accepted if the tests are not passing. This is a new if's/and's or buts about it.
- No PR will be accepted without referencing the appropriate ticket. New features should use the feature request template and be accepted before your work begins.
- PR's should add meaningful content to the game, not just for you but for other players as well. Think about how this would affect the larger player base at hand.
- No PR will be accepted if it adds unfavorable advantage to a specific group of players, for example if Dwarves get 50% XP bonus but all other races do not.

I, The Creator have all rights to reject any and all PR's and feature requests for any reason. While this would not generally happen some instances where it could, not excluding those listd above
are:

- Adds a cash shop or any way for the player or players to spend money.
- Adds ability for players to access aspects of the game they are not allowed too, ie, adding ways to access the various UI APi's used in game.
- Violates the rules of the game.
- Is inherently hard or not easy to understand via the UI.
- Is not documented both in the help section and or code wise.

I welcome contributions from all people regardless how small or large, although large re-writes will require conversations around them. Do not just submit a giant feature request, go off and code it
and expect it, even if tests are passing, to be instantly merged.

When contributing your code should be:

- Clean and easy to read, understand and test.
- Should include proper documentation, tests and updated help documentation for the help section if it drastically changes the way a feature should work or adds a new feature.

Coding style should be:

4 spaces for php files.
2 spaces for js and scss files.
2 spaces for html files.
